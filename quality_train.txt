__label__low el laboratorio del dr. yuri ph´nglui mglw´nafh cthulhu r´lyeh wgah´nagl fhtagn 24 feb 13 etapa ciclista: guillena – castilblanco de los arroyos (13/01/2013) el 13 de enero realicé la primera etapa del año en sevilla. se trató de una pequeña etapa exploratoria, que, pese a todo, dio mucho de sí, aunque por lo general para mal. para empezar, la etapa la empecé cruzado: al ir a coger la bicicleta de la cochera, no fui capaz de encontrar la llave del candado, hasta que caí en la cuenta de que estaba en la guantera del alfa, que se encontraba aparcado en mi plaza de garaje en el trabajo. así pues, no me quedó más remedio que tirar de la vieja conor que utilizo para hacer rodillo. una bici descrita en alguna ocasión como carne de perro: completamente rígida, con unos 18 años a sus espaldas, plato grande de 44 dientes, una corona de 7 piñones, y frenos cantilever. una auténtica delicia. empezamos la etapa algo tarde, al filo de las 9:30h. salimos en esta ocasión a rodar miguel, sergio, ricardo y yo. y si yo había empezado mal la etapa, miguel no tardó en añadirse a la lista de infortunios: apenas salir, en plena subida por un olivar, clavó la rueda, por culpa del barro, en una rodera, lo que lo hizo salir despedido por encima del manillar y dar de cara en el suelo. por fortuna el incidente apenas se saldó con la nariz hinchada y el labio roto por el interior de la boca lo que, para lo que podía haber sido, fue bastante poco. aun así, miguel decidió continuar. yo, por el camino, había descubierto algo sumamente interesante, y era que a la lista de problemas de mi bici había que añadirle otro: las pastillas de freno estaban cristalizadas, por lo que su capacidad de frenado era puramente testimonial. y eso, con un descenso por trialera por efectuar, era algo sumamente tranquilizador. dejamos atrás infortunios y trepamos por la trialera del camino de santiago. gracias a unas recientes lluvias, las mismas que habían hecho que hubiera barro en el olivar, el tramo de la trialera se encontraba en un estado de firme excelente: la tierra se encontraba compactada, pero sin llegar a estar pegajosa. magnífica para rodar. terminamos de ascender la trialera y llegamos a la pista que lleva a la carretera de castilblanco. desde allí, en vez de girar a la derecha, lo hicimos a la izquierda, siguiendo las marcas blancas y verdes que, según declaraba el ayuntamiento de castilblanco en su web, habrían de conducirnos hasta un mirador sorbre el embalse de gérgal y, probablemente, a una pista que llevara de vuelta a guillena. sin embargo, a donde nos llevó fue a una enorme cancela plantada en mitad del camino. eso sí, ya en descenso, y con una prometedora visión del embalse, que apenas podíamos tocar con los dedos. una gran decepción. volvimos sobre nuestros pasos, y decidimos subir hasta castilblanco. llegamos por carretera sin novedad, y disfrutamos de un pequeño tentempié antes de afronar el tramo final de la etapa: una bajada por carretera hasta la trialera, y por último el descenso por ésta. fue una bajada interesante con la conor: un poco más y se me aflojan los empastes al descender con la rígida sin apenas capacidad de frenado. como elemento pintoresco, nos encontramos con el camino casi bloqueado por unas vacas, así que aprovechamos la ocasión para echarnos unas fotos. los datos de la etapa son los siguientes: distancia: s/d distancia (según el gps): 34’123 km. tiempo de etapa: 2h 14m 43s tiempo desde el inicio de la etapa: 3h 19m 46s velocidad media: 15’2 km/h velocidad máxima: 41’2 km/h

cuesta de la media fanega – el garrobo (20/05/2012) el pasado domingo 20 volví a salir a rodar con mis compañeros de trabajo por sevilla. en esta ocasión realizamos una etapa que mezclaba recorridos tradicionales en nuestras salidas sevillanas con terrenos completamente vírgenes para nosotros, pero que cuentan con gran tradición entre los ciclistas de la zona. empezamos a dar pedales a las 9:00h en las pajanosas, punto de partida de riguroso estreno. salimos de la pedanía en dirección al zoo de guillena, siguiendo el trazado de la ruta del agua. al pasar el zoo abandonamos el asfalto y entramos en pista, por zona de dehesa al principio, que pronto daría paso a las últimas estribaciones de la campiña sevillana antes de entrar en la sierra. poco después llegamos al cordel de la cruz de la mujer, una de nuestras subidas habituales. optamos por abandonar la ruta del agua, evitando el tramo restringido, y atacar la subida directamente. afrontamos las primeras rampas de la subida a un ritmo bastante alegre, con rafa en cabeza, hasta que nos percatamos que había un pájaro carpintero enganchado por el pecho en un alambre de espino, por lo que no pudimos evitar detenernos para hacer la buena acción del día. entre los tres desenganchamos al pobre pájaro, y le devolvimos la libertad, no sin echarnos unas fotos con él. una vez finalizado el incidente, seguimos con la subida, igualmente a un ritmo bastante alegre. demasiado alegre, quizás, sabiendo lo que teníamos aún por delante. pero ya estábamos lanzados, y no había vuelta atrás. seguí marcando un ritmo bastante intenso, y con miguel a mi zaga, rápidamente alcanzamos el punto más alto del cordel, previo a un trepidante descenso (52 km/h por pista bacheada), como siempre, por la cuesta de la lenteja. llegamos a la cantina a las 10:00h, donde hicimos una breve parada. desde allí continuamos a la siguiente escala de la jornada: la central. ascendimos por la margen derecha del ribera de huelva, primero por pista, hasta la central de bombeo, y luego por asfalto, hasta la central. iba a ser una etapa con gran cantidad de recorrido por asfalto. llegamos a la central a las 10:45. llevábamos ya 24 de los 41 kilómetros en los que había calculado la etapa. no se puede negar que el ritmo estaba siendo sumamente alegre: 14 km/h de media, incluyendo las paradas. y es que la gran cantidad de asfalto se estaba dejando notar. la mañana, además, era propicia para rodar, ya el día amenazaba lluvia y no hacía calor ni bochorno. tras esta parada -la cuarta y última del día- afrontamos la pared que teníamos por delante: una subida de 7 kilómetros hasta la cuesta de la media fanega, primero, y a la venta del alto, después, con una pequeña bajada intermedia. el primer tramo tenía una pendiente máxima del 11%, y el segundo, aunque algo más asequible en perfil, destacaba con una pendiente máxima del 13’3%. al menos se trataba de subidas por asfalto. de nuevo abrí fuego con un ritmo alegre, que nos permitió sobrepasar a un par de grupos de ciclistas en nuestra subida. el primer tramo de la subida lo realizamos a velocidades de 12-14 km/h… y eso conteniendo. una vez que llegamos a la cuesta de la media fanega, realizamos la subida por el trazado antiguo (no el correspondiente a la autovía -obviamente- ni a la n-630), por un excelente tramo de carretera que no cuenta con uso alguno. llegamos a la venta del alto a las 11:25h. desde allí todo lo que teníamos por delante era descenso. e íbamos a disfrutarlo. desde la venta del alto nos encaminamos a el garrobo por un sendero en paralelo a la carretera nacional. atravesamos el pueblo en compañía de un terceto ciclista, que nos iban marcando el camino. salimos del pueblo y realizamos un rápido descenso por asfalto de 2 kms. hasta alcanzar la trialera de el garrobo. allí dos de los ciclistas siguieron por carretera, y el tercero se metió por la trialera, como hicimos nosotros. la trialera desde el garrobo a las pajanosas es sumamente divertida. no es especialmente complicada, pero te permite hacer un descenso de 5 kms. entre cercas de piedra, con tramos de piedra no excesivamente técnicos, pero sí bastante interesantes. se vadean, además, dos arroyos, y se pasa por bastantes tramos de vegetación cerrada. una delicia, vaya. dejo a continuación un vídeo de una etapa muy similar a la nuestra (salvo porque ellos salen de guillena y suben por el tramo restringido), en la que se puede ver bastante bien lo que es la etapa (la trialera a partir del minuto 3:45): nosotros, por nuestra parte, tras la trialera cruzamos sobre la autovía, y entramos en las pajanosas justo a las 12:00h, tras nuestros 41 kms. de etapa. una etapa rápida, intensa y bastante divertida. matamos la sed y comentamos un poco la etapa en uno de los múltiples bares que se encuentran en las pajanosas, antes de dar por finiquitada la etapa. una etapa que espero se vuelta a repetir. distancia: 41’891 km. distancia (según el gps): 41’932 km. tiempo

plata (15/01/2012) el pasado domingo salimos a rodar mis compañeros de trabajo miguel, rafa, manolo y yo por la sierra norte de sevilla. aunque durante toda la semana el tiempo había sido excelente, la predicción para el domingo no era especialmente buena: durante los días previos había anunciada agua toda la mañana, pero la última predicción para el domingo había mejorado bastante, y no daba agua hasta mediodía, decidimos mantener la hora de salida a las 9:00h. de entre las propuestas de etapa que teníamos sobre la mesa, escogimos realizar una de escala media: la subida y bajada desde guillena a castilblanco de los arroyos por la trialera de la vía de la plata. empezamos a la hora prevista, con cielo cubierto, y amenazando lluvia. y completamente solos en el campo, con la sola excepción de un grupo de jubilados que estaban haciendo el camino. llegamos a la doble portela pasadas las 10:00h, y allí empezó a chispear. planteamos dar la vuelta, pero al final optamos por finalizar el tramo de la trialera, y allí decidir. así pues, seguimos subiendo, ya equipados con los impermeables, pero la lluvia no sólo no aflojaba, sino que comenzó a arreciar. a las 10:25h llegamos al final de la trialera, y a la pista que conduce a la carretera de castilblanco. quizás la idea más razonable era volver sobre nuestros pasos, pero la perspectiva de un buen colacao caliente y unas tostadas eran demasiado tentadoras. así que nos dirigimos hacia castilblanco. llegamos a la entrada de castilblanco a las 10:50h, y paramos en el primer bar que vimos abierto, en el polígono de la cruz alta. estábamos chorreando, y llegamos al bar -un mesón, más bien- en el momento en que la lluvia caía con más intensidad. tanto era así, que incluso se produjo un apagón en la zona. meditamos irnos, pero se nos hacía cuesta arriba volver a salir a la lluvia con la que estaba cayendo. por suerte, la luz volvió pronto y pudimos disfrutar de unas excelentes tostadas con el colacao bien caliente. reanudamos la etapa a las 11:25h. por suerte a esa hora la lluvia había aminorado su intensidad, por lo que aprovechamos para emprender rápidamente el descenso. por el camino, muy cerca de castilblanco, volvimos a cruzarnos con el grupo de peregrinos. se me pasó por la cabeza la moral de esa pobre gente, haciendo el camino con la que estaba cayendo. pero la verdad era que, bien pensado, pobres de nosotros: ellos, al menos, ya estaban a punto de terminar el día, mientras que nosotros ¡aún teníamos que volver! la semana pasada había traído de córdoba la ghost de doble suspensión con la idea de realizar la bajada de la trialera a saco. en realidad, nos encontrábamos allí tan sólo porque tenía ganas de hacer ese descenso. y llegado el momento, me encontré con que no había manera de realizar el descenso a saco. con la que había caído, la trialera estaba completamente embarrada, con las piedras húmedas y con mucha vegetación. en suma: sumamente peligrosa. aún así realicé el descenso bastante fuerte, lo que me ocasionó un susto en una de las zonas más comprometidas: clavé completamente la horquilla de 120 mm. en un quebrado, y a punto estuve de salir por encima del manillar. la bici se me encabritó, y acabé con la rueda trasera a la altura de mi cabeza. lo que no sé es cómo no me caí de boca en las piedras. por parte, miguel, manolo y rafa también sufrieron alguna que otra caída, afortunadamente sin incidentes. el resto de la bajada fue sumamente divertido, técnico, peligroso y emocionante. por suerte, además, escampó, por lo que pudimos realizar una bajada menos comprometida. sin embargo, y con diferencia, el último tramo de la bajada, por la pista de los olivares hasta el polígono, fue la más peligrosa de todas. el camino estaba completamente embarrado, con el típico barro arcilloso de la campiña, que se pega como un engrudo a las cubiertas. en mi caso, acabé con la high roller de 2.35” y la michelin country mud de 2.00” completamente lisas de barro. un barro sumamente deslizante, que provocó que patinara, cual si estuviera sobre una pista de patinaje, a la hora de ir a cruzar una pequeña rodera. acabé, como no podía ser menos, en el suelo de la manera más tonta. afortunadamente sin incidentes. el resto de la bajada no fue mucho más sencillo. en la parte final de la bajada la cubierta delantera y el puente de la horquilla acumularon tanto barro que se formó un mazacote que dejó bloqueada la rueda delantera. jamás hubiera pensado que eso pudiera pasar con una bicicleta equipada con frenos de disco -a diferencia de los frenos v-brake o cantilever, que es mucho más común. tras algunos incidentes por el estilo, llegamos al polígono a las 12:35h. cubierto de barro, como no podía ser menos. rápidamente nos dirigimos a un lavadero de coches, para deshacernos del barro. y justamente allí fue donde empezó a descargar la lluvia nuevamente. pero era tanto el barro, y tan pegajoso, que no quedó más remedio que quitárnoslo con las pistolas de agua a presión. tras la limpieza, dimos por finalizada la etapa, no sin un último percance por mi parte: partí mis veteranas gafas spiuk, que ya se encontraban algo deterioradas, al quitármelas durante la limpieza. en cuanto a la etapa, hay que admitir que quizás fuera algo arriesgado, vista la predicción, mantener la convocatoria. lo cierto es que la predicción había mejorado, y calculábamos poder terminar antes de que… qué narices. sabíamos de sobra que iba a llovernos, y aun así nos fuimos porque nos pareció divertido. y divertido fue, vaya que sí. los datos de la etapa son los siguientes: distancia (según el velocímetro): 29’63 km. distancia (según el gps): 29’972 km. tiempo de etapa: 2h 28m 6s tiempo desde el inicio de la etapa: 2h 32m 43s

sposób postępowania w takich okolicznościach zależy przede wszystkich od zapisów umowy zlecenie i od tego, czy wykonawca zlecenia mimo choroby zrealizował wszystkie umówione czynności czy też nie. zgłębiając poruszony wątek, należy podkreślić, że: umowy zlecenia nie podlegają regulacjom kodeksu pracy lecz przepisom kodeksu cywilnego i w stosunku do nich nie ma zastosowania np. rozporządzenie ministra pracy i polityki socjalnej z 29 maja 1996 r. w sprawie sposobu ustalania wynagrodzenia w okresie niewykonywania pracy oraz wynagrodzenia stanowiącego podstawę obliczania odszkodowań, odpraw, dodatków wyrównawczych do wynagrodzenia oraz innych należności przewidzianych w kodeksie pracy, w myśl art. 734 § 1 kodeksu cywilnego, przez umowę zlecenia przyjmujący zlecenie zobowiązuje się do dokonania określonej czynności prawnej dla dającego zlecenie. zgodnie z art. 735 § 1 kodeksu cywilnego, jeżeli ani z umowy, ani z okoliczności nie wynika, że przyjmujący zlecenie zobowiązał się wykonać je bez wynagrodzenia, za wykonanie zlecenia należy się wynagrodzenie, nie ma powszechnie obowiązujących regulacji, które by nakazywały zmniejszanie wynagrodzenia zleceniobiorcy za czas niedyspozycji zdrowotnej lub wskazywały na sposób wyliczania takiego pomniejszenia. jeżeli w treści umowy zlecenia nie ma zapisów, które by odnosiły się do kwestii zachowywania lub utraty prawa do wynagrodzenia za okresy choroby, wówczas za uzasadniony należy uznać pogląd, iż wynagrodzenie może być zredukowane tylko wtedy, gdy zatrudniona osoba nie wykonała w pełni zleconych prac z powodu kłopotów zdrowotnych. w sytuacji, gdy mimo zachorowania, zleceniobiorca zrealizował zlecenie w całości, brak jest podstaw do redukowania zapłaty za pracę. z uwagi na fakt braku ustanowienia przez ustawodawcę normy określającej metodę pomniejszania wynagrodzenia wykonawcy zlecenia za dni chorobowe, rozstrzygnięcie tego zagadnienia w przypadku umów gwarantujących stawkę wynagrodzenia wyrażoną miesięczną kwotą, pozostaje zasadniczo w gestii zleceniodawcy. może on przykładowo: podzielić kwotę miesięcznego wynagrodzenia przez liczbę dni kalendarzowych miesiąca i pomnożyć otrzymany wynik przez liczbę dni wykonywania w tym miesiącu pracy będącej przedmiotem umowy, ustalić w jakim procencie zleceniobiorca zrealizował w danym miesiącu przedmiot zlecenia i przemnożyć wyznaczoną stawkę procentową przez miesięczną należność za pracę (np. jeśli wykonawcy zlecenia za miesiąc przysługiwała zapłata na poziomie 1500 zł, a we wrześniu wskutek choroby wykonał tylko 70% procent zlecenia, wówczas jego wrześniowe wynagrodzenie byłoby wyliczone następująco: 1500 zł x 70% = 1050 zł). pamiętajmy, że od 1 stycznia 2017 r. obowiązuje minimalna stawka godzinowa dla zleceniobiorców, która wynosi 13 zł. oznacza to, że finalna miesięczna zapłata za pracę po podzieleniu przez liczbę wypracowanych w miesiącu godzin nie może być niższa od 13 zł. w przeciwnym wypadku, zatrudniony powinien otrzymać wyrównanie do 13 zł. artykuł był pomocny?

usccb>media > news releases > la familia migrante tema central de la semana nacional de la migración 2011 december 16, 2010 abordar las causas originarias de la emigración es clave para solucionar patrones migratorios actuales washington (16 de diciembre de 2010)—renovando la esperanza, buscando la justicia es el tema principal de la semana nacional de la migración, 2011 que se celebrará del 2 al 8 de enero próximo en parroquias y diócesis de todo el país. siguiendo el ejemplo del papa benedicto xvi, quien se ha enfocado en las familias migrantes en su mensaje para la jornada mundial del inmigrante y el refugiado 2011, los obispos católicos de estados unidos también centran el mensaje de la semana nacional de la migración sobre la familia, haciendo notar especialmente las tensiones y presiones que la emigración pone sobre la familias y los efectos que el subdesarrollo económico tiene en todo este proceso. “la pobreza sistemática, la inestabilidad económica y la carencia de empleo son las causas fundamentales que dan origen a la emigración no regulada”, afirmó monseñor josé gómez, arzobispo coadjutor de los ángeles. “dadas las desigualdades económicas que separan a las naciones desarrolladas de las naciones en desarrollo y el importante papel que estas diferencias juegan en los patrones migratorios, los obispos católicos han insistido repetidamente en que una política migratoria de puertas abiertas no es la solución al problema de la inmigración ilegal. el desarrollo económico internacional es un componente crucial en la gestión de los patrones migratorios”. el arzobispo gómez, quien es presidente del comité de asuntos migratorios de la conferencia de obispos católicos de estados unidos, resaltó la necesidad de trabajar por el desarrollo económico y social en los países de origen de los inmigrantes para que la gente no se vea forzada a emigrar para poder sostenerse o encontrar una vida mejor para sus familias. “los obispos de los estados unidos, en su carta pastoral juntos en el camino de la esperanza, ya no somos extranjeros hicieron un llamado a estados unidos a ejercer la solidaridad con la comunidad internacional para que ayude a elevar los niveles de vida, defender los derechos humanos y establecer instituciones políticas complementarias en el mundo subdesarrollado para que las personas tengan la oportunidad de prosperar en su tierra natal”, dijo mons. gómez. a nivel interno, pueden tomarse otras medidas para ayudar a regular la inmigración ilegal, tales como que el congreso desarrolle políticas que establezcan avenidas legales de entrada al país para trabajadores con escasa formación académica que se ajusten mejor a las fluctuaciones del mercado. la celebración de la semana nacional de la migración comenzó hace más de un cuarto de siglo cuando los obispos decidieron proporcionar a los católicos una oportunidad para reflexionar sobre la gran diversidad presente en la iglesia y en sus ministerios. conforme el rostro de las iglesias locales cambia, la disponibilidad de materiales que expliquen las necesidades de los inmigrantes y refugiados así como sus contribuciones se ha hecho más importante. estos materiales proporcionan importantes recursos educativos que se pueden usar a lo largo del año individualmente, en familia, o en escuelas y parroquias para aprender más sobre la complejidad de los asuntos que rodean a la inmigración. en colaboración con the catholic university of america (cua), la conferencia de obispos católicos de estados unidos está desarrollando un nuevo sitio web que se enfocará en el importante papel que la iglesia católica ha desempeñado en el reasentamiento de refugiados durante casi siete décadas. se espera que el nuevo portal cibernético esté listo para la primavera y estará localizado en donde ya se encuentran disponibles otros recursos. estos materiales están dirigidos a profesores, directores de educación religiosa y otras personas interesadas en asuntos sobre inmigrantes y refugiados. los materiales para la semana nacional de la migración pueden descargarse directamente de la página web o pueden hacerse pedidos en grandes cantidades de los materiales impresos a través del servicio de publicaciones de usccb llamando al 1-800-235-8722 o vía internet en www.usccbpublishing.org (ver la sección “migrant and refugee services).--- etiquetas: semana

__label__low late victorian english manor dollhouse: 1/12 miniature from scratch saturday, 21 january 2012 miniaturas, final room count, attic plans, and loggia furniture! hello all! i hope everyone has been well. first off, i just want to thank everyone who follows my blog. i never dreamt this many people would take an interest in my work. i hope my blog will keep on inspiring and giving people ideas. thank you all so much! before i start, i just wanted to share some very happy news. "miniaturas" magazine is running a series of articles following my work on dewell manor. i saw the first article just hours before we left for our trip. i have to congratulate pedrete and madelva for putting together such a beautiful article. thank you very much my friends! i am honoured! jo and i had a wonderful vacation. i was worried about a caribbean cruise because i'm not a beach person! the inner child in me is still very strong, so i get bored, restless and annoying in very calm situations. however, i did have a lot of fun. i built a little sand castle , read "the shining" and a hercule poirot mystery, and of course, i thought of dewell manor. as i sat at the back of the boat, looking at the sea, i made a quick sketch, yet again, of what dewell manor would look like from the sunken garden the vision ﻿ the reality before i get to exterior work i want all interiors to be complete. the opening panels will be rather large and i'm afraid i might damage them while i work. i always had a 95% clear vision of the entire manor, except for the attic. happily, after many weeks of thinking, i commited to a floor plan for the top floor. so here is the finalized list of rooms for dewell manor and their measurements in inches: first floor 1.kitchen 20 x 24 2.loggia 13 x 13 3. dining room 16 x 20 4. game room 14 x 33 5. drawing room 17 x 30 6. entrance hall 12 x 34 7. music room 20 x 36 second floor 8. dressing room 20 x 24 9. master bedroom 16 x 20 10. bedroom hall 15 x 31 11. girl's room 14 x 17 12. boy's room 14 x 17 13. gallery and landing 12 x 24 14. library 20 x 36 attic floor 15. morning room 14 x 24 16. sewing room 12 x 16 17.nursery 15 x 21 18. attic hall 10 x 21 19. bathroom 13 x 13 20. gentlemans room 14 x 24 21. office 12 x 16 there will also be a tower, originally a clock tower, but i'm thinking of making it a room instead. because i want the plans to be realistic, a tower means another staircase in the attic. yet again, it will barely be visible, but it will be there! i originally wanted to have servants quarters on the attic floor, but i've decided they all live in small cottages on the grounds of the estate near the main house. i had furniture for the morning room, nursery, and the bathroom, so i got online and ordered a set for the gentleman's room. this room will be visible only through the office double doors, so i wanted a set that would stick out and be noticed. the office will have built in bookcases and will be completley paneled in walnut, so i only need a desk, and the sewing room only needs an armoire and sewing machine. with the furniture purchased, i chose my wallpaper. since i have not worked on the manor, here are pictures of the furniture and the wallpapers to give you an idea what the attic will look like. ﻿ morning room ﻿ morning room ﻿ sewing room ﻿ nursery nursery hall bathroom bathroom tile ﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ gentleman's room ﻿ gentleman's room ﻿one other room i originally had not planned on was the loggia. 2 days before we left, i received the furniture i ordered from the little dollhouse company. the loggia will be red brick and stone, but i want marrocan tiles for the floor and a light fixture with colored crystals. i might also add curtains between the columns to block out the sun. before i tackle the attic, i have 3 rooms left to finish on the second floor. the dressing room, master bedroom and the boy's room. the next 2 weeks i will work on the flooring for these 3 rooms...very boring...and then i will finish them one by one. well, you are now all up to date and i can't wait to get some work done. i hope you all have an absolutely wonderful week. i only had time to pop into some of your blogs, but i promise i will catch up soon. all the best my friends, and once again, thank you all! giac﻿ posted by giac at 10:24 25 comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest monday, 2 january 2012 music room hello everyone. i hope you all had a wonderful new year! i had a week off for christmas and new years, so i wanted to finish the music room before i went back to work. i'm glad to say mission accomplished! the music room is right under the library. i've mentionned that dewell manor is on the edge of a cliff in england. these are the 2 rooms that would have views of the ocean on 3 sides, so i made the windows as big as possible.﻿ the fireplace, overmantel and ceiling cornice are from sue cook, and the colums from unique miniatures i didn't make the arches in the top sections of the windows. the window treatments will cover them, so i saw no reason to spend time on a detail that would be lost. since the paper was busy, the ceiling moulding ornate, and the fabric for the window treatments is a bright blue silk, i decided to keep the rest of the wall detail fairly simple. the most time consuming projects were the atlantides and the marble columns. atlantides are male sculptures that top or replace columns and look as though they are supporting the structure. in a past post i used the term carryatides, but from what i read carryatides are female sculptures. i've only ever sculpted clay once, and that was for the 2 dimensional figures over the great room fireplaces, so in true giac form, i told myself, maybe i'm gifted and just don't know it. well, 2 days later, i can say my work is good, but not great. if anyone ever wants to try sculpting, it's actually a lot of fun. i first tried working with regular clay, but the figures and detail were so small they dried out, cracked and chipped every time i touched them. i then tried super sculpey and i loved it. it's an oven bake clay and i thought it was easy and fun to work with.﻿ i first twisted metal wire so as to make the figures stronger. next i covered the wire frame with sculpey ﻿ the matal wire was in the shape of a t. here it is all covered ﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ i took out some body building magazines and used those as guides to shape the musculature ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ (again, sorry i can't get this picture right side up) i only had 2 sculting tools and needles, so fine details like fingers were left out. with more tools i think i could of done better, but i was more interested in the overall shape of the figures and not the details, so the investment didn't seem worth it. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿ here are the 3 i made, buba, brutus and adam (he was the first finished for the room). when they were done i baked them for 15 minutes. the slimmer ends, like the "hands" burnt a little, but it didn't bother me because i covered them in 2 coats of gesso and then faux-marbled them. i'm proud of them, but know they're good, not great...but man did i ever have a good laugh at my first attempt below this was my very first 3d sculpture ever. jo asked why i was laughing and i told him i created a steroid loving drag queen in a flamenco version of cabaret! laughing at yourself is the best therapy in my opinion. smashing him to start over was also fun! ﻿ the faux marble technique was the same i've used in the past. 2 coates of medium gray brushed on, 1 coat of off-white sponged on, 1 coat of pure white sponged on, then medium gray veins applied with toothpicks. the atlantides were easy enough to paint, the columns were time consuming because of the fluting. ﻿ the columns are from unique miniatures. i had to heat them with a hair dryer till soft to straighten them. i had to cut out a section of the column to make them shorter. it went well, except after a while the razar saw i used with a mitter box heated the resin column and the saw had a hard time going through. the columns in the corners of the room without atlantides will hold busts of great composers. ﻿ this room was really long to put together, but i'm very happy with the result. i wanted this room to be very delicate and feminine, and i think it will be perfect once the curtains are up. on another note, jo and i are going on holiday for a week as of this coming sunday (the next 4 days of work will be murder) so it might be a while before my next post. i hope you all have a wonderful couple of weeks and i will definetely catch up on your blogs when i get back.. i wish you all the best and a great couple of weeks. giac posted by giac at 19:15 24 comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) followers about me giac view my complete profile translate blog archive ► 2018 (1) ► january (1) ► 2017 (5) ► december (1) ► september (1) ► june (1) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► 2016 (5) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► may (1) ► february (1) ► january (1) ► 2015 (7) ► december (2) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► june (1) ► march (1) ► january (1) ► 2014 (10) ► december (1) ► november (1) ► october (1) ► july (1) ► june (1) ► may (2) ► april (1) ► february (1) ► january (1) ► 2013 (11) ► december (2) ► october (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► june (1) ► may (1) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (1) ► january (1) ▼ 2012 (16) ► december (1) ► november (1) ► september (1) ► august (2) ► july (1) ► may (2) ► april (2) ► march (1) ► february (3) ▼ january (2) miniaturas, final room count, attic plans, and log... music room ► 2011 (29) ► december (4) ► november (2) ► october (4) ► september (3) ► august (3) ► july (7) ► june (6) simple theme. powered by blogger.

കാരണമായിട്ടുണ്ട്‌. ഈ മേഖലയില്‍ ഉത്‌പാദനം വളരെ കുറഞ്ഞു. ഇവിടെ ഫലപ്രദമായ ഇടപെടല്‍ അനിവാര്യമാണെന്ന്‌ മന്ത്രി അഭിപ്രായപ്പെട്ടു.തദ്ദേശ സ്വയംഭരണ മേഖലയില്‍ ഇപ്പോള്‍ ബാധ്യത കൂടിവരികയാണ്‌. വരുമാനം കൂട്ടേണ്ടത്‌ അനിവാര്യമാണ്‌. ചില പഞ്ചായത്തുകളില്‍ വസൂലാക്കേണ്ട നികുതി കാര്യക്ഷമമായി ഈടാക്കുന്നില്ല.തൊഴിലുറപ്പ്‌ പദ്ധതി പഞ്ചായത്തുകളില്‍ കാര്യക്ഷമമായി നടക്കുന്നില്ല. സര്‍ക്കാറിന്റെ പണം എങ്ങനെ വേണമെങ്കിലും ഉപയോഗിക്കാം എന്ന ചിന്ത പാടില്ല. പദ്ധതി പ്രകാരം തൊഴിലാളികള്‍ക്ക്‌ കൂലിമാത്രം നല്‌കിയാല്‍ പോരാ, അവര്‍ തൊഴിലെടുക്കുന്നുണ്ടോ, അത്‌ നാടിന്‌ ഗുണപ്രദമാണോ എന്നൊക്കെ ഉറപ്പുവരുത്തണം. പല സ്ഥലങ്ങളിലും ജോലി ചെയ്യിക്കാതെതന്നെ കൂലി നല്‌കുന്ന രിതിയുണ്ട്‌. പെന്‍ഷന്‍ നല്‌കാതെ പിടിച്ചുവെക്കുന്ന രീതിയും ചിലയിടത്തുണ്ട്‌-മന്ത്രി പറഞ്ഞു.പദ്ധതി നിര്‍വഹണത്തിലെ കാലതാമസം ഒഴിവാക്കാന്‍ വ്യക്തമായ ആസൂത്രണം നടപ്പാക്കണം. പദ്ധതി നിര്‍വഹണത്തിന്‌ കാലാവധി നീട്ടിവാങ്ങുന്നത്‌ പതിവായിരിക്കുകയാണ്‌. ഗ്രാമസഭകള്‍ ഇപ്പോള്‍ തട്ടിക്കൂട്ടലുകളായി മാറിയിരിക്കുകയാണ്‌. ആനുകൂല്യം കിട്ടുന്നവരുടെ മാത്രം യോഗമായി മാറിയിരിക്കുന്നു ഇത്‌.ജനകീയാസൂത്രണ പദ്ധതിയുടെ കോട്ടങ്ങള്‍ പരിഹരിക്കാന്‍ നിയോഗിച്ച ഡോ. ഉമ്മന്‍ ചെയര്‍മാനായുള്ള കമ്മിറ്റി റിപ്പോര്‍ട്ട്‌ സര്‍ക്കാറിന്‌ സമര്‍പ്പിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്‌. ആവശ്യമായ മാറ്റങ്ങള്‍ വരുത്തി ജനകീയാസൂത്രണ പദ്ധതി കൂടുതല്‍ കാര്യക്ഷമമാക്കാമെന്നും അദ്ദേഹം പറഞ്ഞു.ടാഗോര്‍ സെന്റിനറി ഹാളില്‍ നടന്ന യോഗത്തില്‍ തദ്ദേശ സ്വയംഭരണ വകുപ്പ്‌ പ്രിന്‍സിപ്പല്‍ സെക്രട്ടറി എസ്‌.എം. വിജയാനന്ദ്‌, പി.കെ. രവീന്ദ്രന്‍,

ധനവകുപ്പ്‌ ഉദ്യാഗസ്ഥര്‍ എതിര്‍ത്തെങ്കിലും ധനമന്ത്രി പ്രത്യേക താത്‌പര്യമെടുത്ത്‌ അംഗീകരിക്കുകയായിരുന്നു.1987-ല്‍ വിദ്യാര്‍ഥികള്‍ക്ക്‌ ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണം നല്‍കാന്‍ രൂപവത്‌കരിച്ച മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുടെ ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണ പരിപാടിയുടെ അക്കൗണ്ടില്‍ കിടന്ന പണമാണ്‌ വണ്ടി വാങ്ങാന്‍ എടുക്കുന്നത്‌. ഫണ്ടില്‍ 4.28 കോടി രൂപ ഇപ്പോഴുണ്ട്‌. മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുടെ പദ്ധതിയായിട്ടാണ്‌ ഇത്‌ വിഭാവനം ചെയ്‌തതെങ്കിലും പിന്നീട്‌ വിദ്യാര്‍ഥികള്‍ക്ക്‌ ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണം നല്‍കാനുള്ള അരി കേന്ദ്രസര്‍ക്കാര്‍ സൗജന്യമായി നല്‍കിത്തുടങ്ങി. ഇതോടെ സംസ്ഥാനത്ത്‌ രൂപവത്‌കരിച്ച ഫണ്ട്‌ ഹെഡ്‌മാസ്റ്റര്‍മാര്‍ക്ക്‌ ഇതുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ട്‌ ഉണ്ടാകുന്ന മറ്റുചെലവുകള്‍ക്ക്‌ നല്‍കാനായി ഉപയോഗിച്ചുതുടങ്ങി. എങ്കിലും പണം മിച്ചം കിടക്കുകയായിരുന്നു. ഇതിനിടെ ഇങ്ങനെയൊരു ഫണ്ട്‌ ഉണ്ടെന്ന വസ്‌തുത വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ വകുപ്പിന്റെ ശ്രദ്ധയില്‍ നിന്ന്‌ മാഞ്ഞു.ശ്രദ്ധിക്കപ്പെടാതെ കിടന്ന ഫണ്ടാണിതെന്നും അതിനാല്‍ വാഹനം വാങ്ങാന്‍ അനുവദിക്കണമെന്നുമായിരുന്നു വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ വകുപ്പിന്റെ ആവശ്യം. ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണ പരിപാടി ഫലപ്രദമായി നടപ്പാക്കാന്‍ ജില്ലകളില്‍ വാഹനം വേണമെന്നായിരുന്നു ന്യായം. എന്നാല്‍ ശ്രദ്ധിക്കപ്പെടാതെ കിടന്ന പണം സര്‍ക്കാരിലേക്ക്‌ മുതല്‍ക്കൂട്ടണമായിരുന്നുവെന്നും ഇത്‌ ചെയ്യാത്തതിന്‌ ഡി.പി.ഐ.യോട്‌ വിശദീകരണം ചോദിക്കണമെന്നുമായിരുന്നു ധനവകുപ്പിന്റെ ശുപാര്‍ശ. ഡി.പി.ഐ.യോട്‌ വിശദീകരണം ചോദിക്കണമെന്ന ശുപാര്‍ശ അംഗീകരിച്ച ധനമന്ത്രി വാഹനം വാങ്ങുന്നതിന്‌ അനുമതി നല്‍കുകയായിരുന്നു.ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണ പരിപാടിക്കുള്ള പണമെടുത്ത്‌ വാഹനം വാങ്ങുന്നതിനോട്‌ വിദ്യാഭ്യാസ വകുപ്പില്‍ത്തന്നെ എതിര്‍പ്പുയര്‍ന്നിട്ടുണ്ട്‌. ഡി.ഡി.മാര്‍ക്കെല്ലാം ഇപ്പോള്‍ത്തന്നെ സര്‍ക്കാര്‍ വാഹനം നല്‍കിയിട്ടുണ്ട്‌. ഇതിന്‌ പുറമെ ഈയാവശ്യത്തിനായി ഓരോ വാഹനം കൂടി നല്‍കുന്നത്‌ ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണ പരിപാടിയുടെ ചുമതല ജില്ലകളില്‍ വഹിക്കുന്ന സീനിയര്‍ സൂപ്രണ്ടുമാര്‍ക്ക്‌ ഉപയോഗിക്കാനാണെന്ന്‌ കരുതുന്നു.ഇപ്പോള്‍ എട്ടാം ക്ലാസുവരെയാണ്‌ കുട്ടികള്‍ക്ക്‌ ഉച്ചഭക്ഷണം നല്‍കുന്നത്‌. കൂടുതല്‍ പണമുണ്ടെങ്കില്‍ ഒമ്പത്‌, പത്ത്‌ ക്ലാസുകള്‍ വരെ ഇത്‌ വ്യാപിപ്പിക്കണമെന്നും അല്ലെങ്കില്‍ സ്‌കൂളുകളുടെ പൊതുവായ പുരോഗതിക്ക്‌ ഇത്‌ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തണമെന്നുമാണ്‌ ആവശ്യം. ബജറ്റില്‍ അത്‌ പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചിരുന്നെങ്കിലും പണമില്ലാത്തതിനാല്‍ നടപ്പാക്കാനാകാതെ നില്‍ക്കുമ്പോഴാണ്‌ ഈ പണമെടുത്ത്‌ വാഹനം വാങ്ങുന്നത്‌.courtesy: mathrubhumi പോസ്റ്റ് ചെയ്തത് kerala farmer ല്‍ വ്യാഴാഴ്‌ച, ഏപ്രിൽ 09, 2009 1 അഭിപ്രായം: ഈ പോസ്റ്റിലേക്കുള്ള ലിങ്കുകള്‍

(aotss), requesting internet training on sensory motor strategies for continuing education to increase her professional skills. vandita’s private practice focuses on children with sensory processing disorders including add/adhd, si issues, reading and writing problems, and autism. obtaining training for ots is difficult in india and often traveling for ce is the norm. as a mother of two young children, she did not want to travel; preferring internet learning which she could do at home at less expense. at the time, aotss trainings focusing on sensory motor interventions and strategies consisted of only onsite, 2-day seminars. the learning in this training includes brain gym, irlen method, kinesthetic handwriting, vision training exercises, multiple intelligences, bal-a-visx and low-cost assistive technology with additional mentoring via the internet after the seminar. , vandita insisted on a similar training via the internet and was willing to pay for personal mentoring which would include. she paid me to develop a personalized mentoring program that would include all topics in the 2-day seminar. this began a one year relationship and learning experience which blossomed into the sensory motor strategies on a shoestring budget internet training and mentoring program. i sent her training manuals and a box of materials, which a relative traveling from the usa to india brought to her, eliminating the high cost of international postage and handling. from these materials, along with recycled and low cost items she could find in india, vandita created treatment materials of excellent quality and creativity, as well as, learned and used the methods of intervention. she received specific lessons via email with ongoing instruction and guidance, and excelled in using the skills learned, quickly observing positive results with her clients. to document her work, she sent me original treatment plans and pictures of her creations via email, documenting how these were used in her practice and the benefits. vandita’s ability to translate emailed lessons and instruction into practical, creative, and effective strategies for her clients was inspiring to me, her mentor. new options for client treatment became so successful that she requested i come to teach others in mumbai, india. negotiations and preparation for the trip from the usa to india took 5 months of planning seminar details and marketing to local professionals and parents to obtain enough participants to make the trip financially feasible. judging from the excellent post seminar evaluations from 27 highly trained professionals who participated, the relationship is evolving into an ongoing one, with another multi-disciplinary training in the planning for next year. participants came from many different cultural and religious backgrounds, experience levels, special and regular education settings, private practice, and disciplines (ot, slp, psychology, business management, educators, administration and parents of children with special needs. prior to the seminar in mumbai, i traveled to southern india’s kerala region to participant in therapeutic yoga training at an ashram, spiritual hindu center, with over 400 people from over 30 countries. i learned the health benefits of breathing in a special way, as well as, the use of yoga exercises for muscle strengthening, range of motion, stretching of muscles and joints for release of tension and limitation, and relaxation techniques for stress management for the mind and body. i learned interesting massage techniques from highly trained auervetic medicine massage therapists and doctors. i traveled through many low-income villages and communities traveling to and from the ashram, where people live in small shacks, with few modern conveniences like running water and electricity, and one dollar can feed a family for a day. i saw infants, children and adults with horrible deformities and major disabilities begging for money on the streets, living where accessibility and independence is not feasible due to many social, economic and environmental barriers including ancient stone and concrete architecture, narrow dirt roads with no room for pedestrian movement or widening, and extreme poverty i never witnessed in the usa, even during my 25 years working in inner city ghettos. the good news is that awareness of educating special needs children and employing adults with disabilities is growing, as india becomes increasingly more affluent and educational opportunities expand, especially with the help of dedicated and highly trained ots in india. some of them received work experience in the usa after their schooling in india, and returned to work in india, bringing a fearless public awareness about ot, civil rights for people with disabilities, and the benefits to society of rehabilitation and independent living support systems. they are spreading the word about the need for trained professional and community supports and cost effective accommodations in work, home, school and community settings. i met ots involved in advocacy for ot services telling me their success in the last few years in obtaining media attention. special education is not mandated by the government, as regular education is, so this must be raised from private sources in order to happen. while in mumbai, i was hosted royally and housed by vandita’s family and the family of her husband, vitkas, in two very different sections of mumbai. one lives a mixed area of middle and low income muslim, christian, and hindu cultures and the other mostly upper middle class hindus. in this affluent neighborhood i witnessed cows walking the street freely as sacred animals rarely killed for food, but used for their milk and dairy products. the indian food cooked in restaurants and homes was exceptional and vegetarian, making it very easy to be kosher during my entire trip. in fact i found it very easy to be jewish in place where there were no jewish people since spirituality and respect for those of other faiths is part of hindu society and religion. i discovered the existence of an ancient indian jewish community in mumbai, called the benai israel, but the location was too far to walk to synagogue. due to two community weddings there was no place for me to stay within the community but another other shabbat i would have gladly been hosted by strangers in the jewish community. at vandita’s parent’s home, i was able to have a peaceful shabbat with ongoing attention and support for my special needs as an observant jew. generosity, compassion and a universal spirituality and respect were major qualities of vandita’s family and their hosting of me for over a week. we shared our religions, cultures, family, professional insights and experiences with each other, her network of friends and therapists/educators, and her family of 3 generations, which included her 10 and 13 year old children. of course i went sightseeing, both into the magnificent mumbai city center with museums, ornate architecture and gardens, the harbor and beach and the site of the mumbai terrorist attacks which killed many americans. traffic jams and crazy drivers of cars, buses, trucks, taxis, and motorcycles was frightening to my western experience living in the much smaller and less congested city of baltimore, md. in india it is common to see a mother holding infant, a small child and husband all riding together on a motorcycle without helmets in city traffic or on bumpy, dusty, narrow country dirt roads. seeing this was quite a shock, especially having worked in physical and cognitive rehabilitation with tbi, spinal cord injuries, etc from vehicle accidents. security is very tight which gave me a secure feeling. there is a travel advisory warning from the us customs office for all americans traveling to india after the december 25, 2009 attempted suicide bombing on an airplane in the usa, as well as, due to the after shock of the mumbai massacres last year. i prayed at the sites of those terrorist attacks in hopes of helping to continue the healing for all families affected by the tragedy and visited a memorial inside the taj hotel made of a wall of falling water with the names of the victims. indians are still shocked and feeling the tragedy which shook the world for 4 days as arab terrorists tortured and killed innocent people, especially foreigners and jewish people. my ot host for my last day in india, mugda, lived in the usa for 8 years as a traveling therapist and returned to mumbai, her ancestral home and family, where she married and began a multidisciplinary therapy practice. she owns the building housing the clinic and hires a speech therapist, physical therapist, and psychologist to work as a team with special needs children and their parents and medical/educational support systems. one of the most inspiring events of my trip was a visit to the spj sadnana school, a privately funded special education program for elementary through high school aged students with autism, add/adhd, developmental disabilities, dyslexia, and many other disabilities which prevent them from being included in regular education environments. the students are happy, productive and achieve skills in both academic, life skills and vocational skills that were previous never thought possible by their parents and society. parents must participate in training and support the educational program in order for their child to participate in the program. teachers and therapists are provided ongoing training in innovative and low-cost interventions and learning programs, sending employees oversees when necessary for training if it will help students to learn and function better. mentoring and support are ongoing for professionals, students and parents. the administrators are role models, demonstrating selfless and unconditional love, caring, and professionalism rarely found elsewhere in the world. in my 35 year career in education, i rated this school with the best i have encountered in my travels and job experience in the usa. student vocational, self care, social, emotional, behavioral and academic skills are carefully evaluated and supported each and every step of their participation at sadnana school. sadnana administration paid for over 10 staff members to attend my training. one could see their professionalism demonstrated. sadnana school’s ability to accept students of all economic backgrounds depends upon private donations. they do not turn away students if the parents cannot pay and many parents join the staff as volunteers and then become employees, encouraged by the administration to obtain professional degrees and training. students participate in an half hour of brain gym exercises and other physical movements prior to beginning their academic program daily and later in the day as well. they use brain gym exercises embedded within their academic program when they began seeing behavioral and academic improvements with these simple neuromuscular and sensory motor exercises. their vice principal is an irlen method screener and certified brain gym consultant, having to travel to other countries to receive here training. please help if you can by sending even a small donation to support their amazing work for children and young adults with disabilities to become productive members of society with the maximum level of independence. all contributions are tax deductible and they are a non profit with all funds utilized for the benefit of students. the sadnana school’s building is simple yet practical, but the program is built on commitment to quality programming, professionalism, standards, and increasing knowledge, using low cost traditional and innovative techniques requiring minimal equipment such as brain gym, irlen method, auditory training, sensory integration, therapy, vocational skills training in crafts, office and computer skills, food/hospitality services, textiles/sewing/printing, diamond sorting, and many other vocations. they insure that students who are capable of taking national educational tests get accommodations in order to participate and succeed.

__label__low artist: steve dinsdalealbum: on the other sidereleased: january 2011label: northern echo on the other side (47'46") is (among other things) a tribute to the single-mindedness of the solo artist. although steve dinsdale continues to be a significant part of radio massacre international, his artistic vision must disappear against the immensity of the trio's dense free-form concept. with this, his second solo cd, dinsdale probes deeper into his own ideas about music and sound. his determination to be a part of something creative every single day is dinsdale's ideal and his audience's delight - as this cd is the result of many a day's creative encounter with music. we hear a mood of celebration in these tracks, along with a healthy dose of 1970s german space rock. with dinsdale playing drums and percussives beneath cycling sequencer patterns and lilting synth melodies, the first few tracks from on the other side gently propels the album through the prog era and on into the 21st century. these pieces are tightly arranged and unfold in a friendly way out into the listening space. the last four of the eight tracks make up the title work, and an interesting suite of music it is. dinsdale does give this collage continuity, yet the music remains open and spacious. more atmospheric and textural than the previous songs, this area and its easy kinetic flow engage the listener with dancing arpeggios, breathy chorus, ethereal flutes, synth strings and a pleasing melodic confluence. on the other side will seem familiar, but not at all derivative. it is nothing less than a true expression of dinsdale's being - which means that this music was not learned, it was lived. - chuck van zyl/star's end 3 march 2011 | reviews |

при покупке можно подобрать именно тот вариант, который гармонично впишется в интерьер помещения.пленкаакустическое оформлениеакустическое оформлениеособенности конструкции ас, оказывающие непосредственное влияние на качество звука. возможные варианты акустического оформления: фазоинверторного типа, закрытого типа, открытого типа, с пассивным излучателем, . корпус у акустики закрытого типа представляет собой герметично закрытый ящик с выведенным на фронтальную панель диффузором (излучателем звука) динамика. недостатки такой акустики - низкая чувствительность, не очень глубокий бас, преимущества - простота конструкции и хорошие переходные характеристики, которые гарантируют низкий уровень искажений и точное воспроизведение звука. колонки с фазоинвертором имеют закрытый корпус, на одной из стенок или на дне которого есть выходное отверстие (или порт) фазоинвертора, соединяющий внутренний объем акустической системы с внешним миром. сам фазоинвертор представляет собой трубку определенной длины, подобранной так, что звуковая волна, излучаемая тыловой стороной диффузора, переворачивается по фазе и выходит через порт. в результате звуковые волны от тыльной и от фронтальной поверхностей диффузора складываются, увеличивая уровень звукового давления громкоговорителя. преимущества такой акустики - высокая чувствительность, воспроизведение самых глубоких басов, малые размеры (по сравнению с аналогичными колонками закрытого типа). недостатки - плохая переходная характеристика, которая проявляется на практике в небольшом "размазывании" звука. разновидность колонок фазоинверторного типа - колонки с пассивным излучателем, или "пассивным радиатором". по конструкции они напоминают колонки с фазоинвертором, но вместо него в дополнительное отверстие устанавливается пассивный излучатель. он представляет собой часть низкочастотного громкоговорителя без катушки и магнитной системы и выполняет ту же роль, что и фазоинвертор. пассивный излучатель подбирается таким образом, чтобы его резонансная частота была равна нижней рабочей частоте громкоговорителя. это позволяет улучшить воспроизведение низких частот. такая конструкция часто используется в сабвуферах. одно из преимуществ пассивного радиатора перед колонками с обычным фазонвертором - это отсутствие шума воздушного потока в трубе резонатора. акустические системы открытого типа встречаются очень редко, в них корпус представляет собой толстую панель, в которую установлены динамики. такие громкоговорители обеспечивают акустическое излучение дипольного типа (см. "акустическое излучение"), то есть звуковые колебания от колонки распространяются как с фронта, так и с тыла. благодаря тому, что в таких колонках практически отсутствует корпус, сведены к минимуму все негативные вибрации, которые возникают при резонансе в колонках с "обычным" корпусом. "открытые" колонки можно устанавливать близко к стене, поскольку звук практически не распространяется в боковом направлении. в колонках открытого типа ослаблено воспроизведение низких частот, поэтому производителям приходится устанавливать нч-динамики очень большого размера (значительно больше, чем в закрытых колонках или в колонках с фазоинвертором). bandpass или полосовой корпус содержит в себе элементы закрытого ящика и корпуса с фазоинвертором. такой корпус разделен перегородкой на две части. одна часть - полностью закрытая, а вторая имеет доступ наружу в виде тоннеля фазоинвертора, через который бас в концентрированном виде подается наружу. низкочастотный динамик крепится на перегородке. основное преимущество полосового корпуса - высокий кпд. другими словами, динамик, установленный в bandpass, будет звучать громче, чем тот же динамик, установленный в корпусе закрытого типа. помимо этого, сабвуфер в полосовом корпусе выдает звук в узкой полосе низких частот. в большинстве современных акустических систем используется конструкция с фазоинвертором. с фазоинверторомцветцветописание основного цвета корпуса или внешней отделки.черныйцвет пылезащитной сеткицвет пылезащитной сеткиописание цвета пылезащитной сетки. пылезащитная сетка (гриль) служит для защиты динамиков от пыли и других внешних воздействий.черный характеристикиколичество полосколичество полосколичество полос, на которое разбит частотный диапазон колонки. полоса - это поддиапазон всего спектра воспроизводимых акустической системой частот. для разных звуковых частот используются разные по конструкции динамики. 2минимальная частота, гцминимальная частота, гц минимальная частота сигнала, которую способна воспроизводить акустика. частотный диапазон, воспринимаемый человеческим ухом, составляет приблизительно 20-20000 гц. частотный диапазон ас зависит от назначения громкоговорителя. если акустическая система приобретается для составления комплекта к домашнему кинотеатру и будет использоваться в качестве тыловой акустики, то она может иметь частотный диапазон 100-20000 гц. но если нужны фронтальные колонки для стереосистемы, то и диапазон частот должен быть шире, например, 20-35000 гц. диапазон частот сабвуфера (громкоговорителя, который предназначен для усиления только низких частот) может быть от 20 до 150 гц. чем ниже минимальная воспроизводимая частота, тем более качественный звук способна воспроизвести акустическая система. 45сопротивление, омсопротивление, омноминальное значение сопротивления (импеданса) колонки. импеданс — полное электрическое сопротивление по переменному току. при подаче музыкального сигнала, который представляет собой переменный ток, сопротивление головки будет меняться в зависимости от частоты сигнала. в целом импеданс никак напрямую не связан с качеством звучания той или иной ас. производители указывают этот параметр для того, чтобы сопротивление учитывали при подключении акустической системы к усилителю. если значение сопротивления колонки ниже, чем у усилителя, в звучании будут присутствовать искажения; если выше, то звук будет значительно тише. 8тип вч динамикатип вч динамикатип высокочастотного излучателя акустической системы в зависимости от его формы и конструкции. тип излучателя влияет на характер звучания громкоговорителя. каждая конструкция излучателя имеет определенный оттенок звучания. если при организации домашнего кинотеатра подбираются колонки различных производителей или из разных линеек, желательно, чтобы они были близки по характеру звучания. в настоящее время распространены следующие варианты излучателей: купол, конус, ленточный, кольцевой, рупор, bmr. излучатель в форме купола (как выпуклого, так и вогнутого) обычно применяется для воспроизведения высоких частот. диффузор в форме конуса, как правило, используется в нч- и сч-динамиках. ленточный диффузор выполнен в виде тонкой ленты. он одновременно играет роль излучателя и проводника тока в магнитном поле; имеет малый вес. обычно используется для воспроизведения высоких и средних частот. кольцевой диффузор иногда применяется в высокочастотных головках. он позволяет добиваться комфортного и детального звучания. рупорные динамики обладают более высоким коэффициентом полезного действия, по сравнению с традиционными вариантами. использование рупора позволяет значительно расширить диаграмму направленности на высоких частотах. bmr (balanced mode radiator) — новый тип конструкции излучателя, в котором сочетаются две модели создания звука. это работа "волны изгиба", которая характерна для плоских диффузоров, и поршневое движение вперед-назад, присущее традиционным динамическим головкам. такое решение позволяет значительно расширить воспроизводимый диапазон частот без заметного увеличения искажений. помимо этого, bmr обеспечивает широкую диаграмму направленности и создает однородное звуковое поле, делая комфортным прослушивание акустики для нескольких человек. купольныйтип сч/нч динамикатип сч/нч динамикатип низко-среднечастотного излучателя акустической системы в зависимости от его формы и конструкции. тип излучателя влияет на характер звучания громкоговорителя. каждая конструкция излучателя имеет определенный оттенок звучания. если при организации домашнего кинотеатра подбираются колонки различных производителей или из разных линеек, желательно, чтобы они были близки по характеру звучания. в настоящее время распространены следующие варианты излучателей: купол, конус, ленточный, кольцевой, рупор, bmr. излучатель в форме купола (как выпуклого, так и вогнутого) обычно применяется для воспроизведения высоких частот. диффузор в форме конуса, как правило, используется в нч- и сч-динамиках. ленточный диффузор выполнен в виде тонкой ленты. он одновременно играет роль излучателя и проводника тока в магнитном поле;

__label__low igotit的空间 igotit的个人博客，关注it，关注互联网，关心生活，写写生活 menu skip to content 首页 文章存档 我的微博 关于博主 search for: tag archives: google google drive终于来了 2012/04/26it与互联网dropbox, google, googledrive, 同步igotit 昨天google drive如期而至，第一时间到它的主页提交了申请。很快，今天凌晨就收到了开通邮件。 其实关注google的人，应该5年前甚至更早前，就不断地在听说关于google drive的各种传闻。我当年还用过一个叫gmail drive shell extension的工具，它可以把gmail改造成一个网络硬盘，映射在“我的电脑”中，非常精彩。当时想象中的google drive，大概也就是这个样子。但这么多年过去了，真正的google drive会是怎样，始终还是没人知道。 没有google drive的这些年，网络存储市场风起云涌，网盘的概念也已经并不新鲜，甚至已经做烂。直到dropbox横空出世，才真正又重新定义了云存储的基本概念。乔布斯一度想收购dropbox未果，于是苹果的icloud也加入了战场。而就在前天，微软也更新了自己的skydrive，以一种更加dropbox-style的多平台桌面同步工具的方式参与竞争。 google drive是不是也就是这样一个简单的dropbox knockoff呢？ 安装完桌面端的应用后，第一感觉的确这就是一个速度飞快、空间只有5gb、功能还不如dropbox的同步工具。但真正了解了google drive的功能，并上手用了一天后，我觉得google的目标远不止于此。 google drive其实是google docs的升级版，如今再打开后者的主页会跳转到前者。但与以前只能打开doc，xls，ppt，pdf等文件不同，现在的google drive在此基础上开放了api，给第三方应用打开了门路。访问chrome web store里的这个页面，可以看到已经有一系列的第三方应用提供了各种文件的浏览及编辑支持，比如照片、视频、思维导图、balsamiq mockups等等。 也就是说，google drive其实是在给基于web的应用提供文件存储的基础架构。在一个充分网络化的环境下，当操作各种文件的应用都不再是装在本地的桌面软件，而是在线的应用时，你其实根本不需要再将文件同步到桌面，然后用桌面软件去打开、编辑、保存，将来这些操作全部可以在浏览器里进行。不论你在哪一家公司的在线应用里编辑哪种格式的文件，最终都可以存储到google drive中来。 更重要的是分享将变得更为简单，协同编辑也将更加普遍。以后你不再需要和老板在往复的email中附上不同版本的文档作为附件，而只需要附上一份在线文档的链接，所有的修改、点评、对比都能集中进行，并且可以实时同步编辑同步更新。 所以google drive远不是一个dropbox knockoff，而更是一个潜在的网络基础设施。跳出传统的桌面环境思维，它与其它“网盘”的区别顿时清晰可见。 同步后的google drive文件夹里原来的在线文档被命名为.gdoc，表格则是.gsheet。如果你双击它们，就会打开chrome浏览器访问熟悉的google docs编辑页面。不过通过chrome web store安装好balsamiq mockups应用后，在本地似乎还没有与.bmml文件关联，目前还只能通过网页里的文件列表来打开。但我想不久后的将来，各种文件格式就会通过chrome来关联到在线应用了吧。 leave a comment 谷歌那些事儿 2010/03/20it与互联网google, 中国igotit 从最早听说谷歌要走的风声，到现在也都几个月过去了。从最开始的吃惊，到怀疑，到爆料，到争吵，到指责，到隔空对话，到又一波行情，到现在大幕即将拉开，真是互联网界难得的一场大戏啊。精彩！ 之前那篇博客，我还在yy后李开复时代的谷歌巨变云云，结果事情的发展完全出乎意料。什么黑客攻击，内鬼偷码之类的事情，通常都只在香港电影中上演的，没想到当时被拉出来吵了个通透，主角居然还是谷歌。连两会都这么高调地拉谷歌来抢新闻点，看李部长点评起谷歌来那风度给翩翩的，尽展我天朝泱泱大国之风采啊。 尽管今上自主知识产权地创造出“不折腾”的讲话精神，这事还是折腾到了现在，大家问题还是没有答案，谷歌走还是不走？ 其实这问题应该也没有那么简单二元，比如研究院撤不撤，手机业务撤不撤等等。当然主要还是google.cn关不关，因为这个关了，心神不灵的大学生搜不到黄图了，焦点访谈就放心了。老实讲，我觉得google还是希望在华开展业务的，不可能有这么大的市场却不去开拓。虽然数据一再显示，在华营收还不及其它市场的零头，但毕竟中国人傻钱多的市场现实还是在那的，李开复“给谷歌中国5000年的耐心”的玩笑也是被接受过的，他们肯定明白市场培育用处和目标，类比微软的放任d版横行以培育市场，ibm的贿赂官员抢占市场等等，谷歌的聪明人应该能学到经营中国市场的游戏规则。 而且中国市场不是说谷歌不抢，就是百度的了，谷歌现在还有个“新”对手叫做bing，人家可是天天都等着谷歌走人呢。谁知道bing会不会把谷歌腾出来的份额给抢完。到时bing就算不一定能超过百度，也凭白造了个对手出来，这又何必呢。而且中国市场就是一个比谁流氓、比谁滥的市场，谷歌毕竟还有个不作恶的信条在那绑着，不能那么放手地干，换了bing来，再加上本来就争着当头号流氓的其它各门户系搜索商，不一起和百度把中国这么点地给闹翻天啊。等谷歌走了将来有天再回来，发现几年不见这已经成了一块完全做烂、不流氓就无法生存的市场时，还想再扛着不作恶的大旗重新开疆拓土，对不起，粉丝们肯定还是欢迎的，只是掏钱的企业主们可能只看疗效，而不关心道德。 再说说政府这边。我相信政府这边非常矛盾，一方面绝对不可能答应谷歌的“不符合中国国情”的要求，一方面又绝对不想谷歌走。好家伙，占有30%的市场份额都走？除非环境太过恶劣，谁还真跟钱过不去啊。这么恶劣的环境，人家都不敢来了怎么办。另一个角度来看，现在人民币的升值压力如此之大，眼看着就快顶不住了。要是真顶不住，一升值，谷歌也差不多的时候撤资走人，那么多外资会不会就借机离场算了，套现走人正好啊，在这受那罪干嘛啊。那么这个撤退的模范作用就非常之不好。 今上和谐来和谐去，被人“不是不愿意被嫖，是嫖客要求太多”给抽一耳光，真是在国际上很掉价。关键眼看着没几年了，想想前上最后那几年那风光得，记得01年曾经还是所谓中国人最成功的一年来着，什么申奥、出线、入组织。而现在国内被央企开心炒地皮，国际被外商怒气抽耳光，到处汇率战贸易战地受气憋屈，实在是不能再搞事加堵添乱了啊。 回过头来再说说李开复。好家伙，太佩服他了，走得真是时候，或者说一走还真就天翻地覆啊。波士堂的主持人说他离职后谷歌中国任命了两个话事人，赞美他这么厉害啊，一个人走了要两个人来接手。结果开复玩滑头，说这是你说的，不是我说的哦。事情发生这么久，谁当然都会想把他拉进来一起搅一搅。不过好像一直一来他就在事情初期在微博上发了句话，就再没有什么表示了，当时他说如果船要沉了，船长肯定不会一个人先走。不管怎么说，他现在是幸福的，远离漩涡中心，拿着8亿投资专心办厂。除了睡眠时间还是非常之短，幸福指数肯定还是比彦宏高。 最新的消息说，下周一就有最新进展发布，不知道这消息确不确切。另外还有说4月美国人民代表大会还要拉谷歌去过堂，这个或许应该不假。接下来是会无止尽地纠缠，还是戏剧性地高潮呢？除了拭目以待和保持激动以外，我们好像也做不了什么事情。 leave a comment google中国将要巨变吗？ 2009/12/12it与互联网google, 中国igotit 这两天连续看到消息说，一说google中国将要撤除研发中心，又说google中国与巨鲸的合作将要中止。虽然消息都没有最终确认，但这些消息的产生、流传，已经说明，李开复所倾心打造的google中国极有可能将走上另一条截然不同的路。不过，这条路从一开始似乎就是必然的，只不过李开复的原因，才来得晚了很多。 在我看来，李开复当初就不是要把外国产品卖到中国来，而是要来创业，要用新模式打造本土的google式的公司，而非一个简单的中国版google。李开复当初回国来创办google中国，绝不是仅仅是要来帮google来开拓中国市场，更重要的是他想把google的那种新的文化带到中国来。所以你会发现媒体上的李开复一直都在强调google的工程师文化，以及强调从总部得到的5000年的市场培育的耐心（也就是不着急盈利的耐心），极力打造的是类似于总部的工作环境，个性办公室、精美的餐厅等，从而提供让工程师自由的创新发挥的平台。 创新模式在他看来非常重要。微软的模式也可以成功，但需要更多的人，更长的时间，而且微软耕耘的pc领域相对来说让人觉得代表的是上世纪90年代甚至80年代。而google的模式，需要的人更少，需要的时间更短，所处的是互联网这个当前最热门、技术发展最快的领域，代表的是最新的文化和创新方式。他常在电视上对比微软和google，“前者是几万人花5年的时间打造一个航空母舰，而后者是几十个人花6个月时间做一辆跑车”。因为google的产品特性，几个或者几十个中国工程师，在6个月到1年的时间里打造适合中国用户的产品的策略，肯定是可行的。将这种google的创新模式带入中国，来做本土化的拓展，才是他真正想做的，而且做好了，可以借助google的品牌和平台，也更容易获得巨大成功。他现在做创新工场的思路，也依然就是google模式的延续。 但google总部不需要这样一个本土公司，这种军阀割据式的市场开拓，对google自身价值观的传播，没有作用，更可能有反作用。像做谷歌音乐搜索，这种绝对只适合于中国市场的模式，对于google全球来说，不可能有推而广之的效应，何况即使在中国市场成功，能贡献的收入规模也达不到要求，食之无味，还不如弃之了事。这类的冲突，李开复在时，还可以平衡，等到他离开后，现在的变化也就是迟早会来临的了。那些与其说讨好中国用户，还不如说讨好中国政府的本土化，虽然使中国用户有了更多的机会去使用google的产品，但也实际影响了google真正的价值观的输出，长久来看，google不可能越来越容忍。想想google maps多早就提供了中文版本，可是因为政策问题，特有的卫星地图偏移问题一直存在，大概一年前，才被用技术手段处理好。这种非常本土化的问题，恰恰并不是技术问题，很难想像想要推广信息自由的价值观的google，会容忍不断地开小灶解决这种“伪问题”。当然，更不用说越来越严格的搜索结果自我审查了。 尽管如此，如果google就此放弃这种无奈的本土化，对于每一个喜爱google的产品和欣赏google文化的用户来说，可能将面临越来越多的麻烦。youtube、blogger、picasa、ghs.google.com……我不希望这个列表越来越长，但如果没有了本土化的缓冲和平衡，立场的差异化会不会带来更剧烈的效应，实在不能不让人更加担心。 one comment so far 提交给google calendar的功能请求实现了 2009/07/29it与互联网googleigotit 功能请求的帖子在这里。 之前google把contacts的功能从gmail里独立了出来，弄了个google contacts。用了之后发现比gmail里的contacts功能要强（现在gmail里的也更新了，和独立的contacts功能一样），主要是可以自己定义一些字段，比如联系人的生日或者纪念日。当时就想如果定义了很多联系人的生日，要是可以自动添加到google calendar里，然后每年到了时间自动提醒，那该多好，也就不用两边都去各添加一遍了。于是就有了上面那个功能请求的帖子。 现在好了，只要到google calendar的设置里，去找一个叫“contacts’ birthdays and events”的日历，添加一下，这样以后在contacts里添加的联系人生日，就会自动在google calendar里出现了。 第一次给google发出功能请求，居然就被接受实现了，哈哈。 在atlanta机场蹭网通宵的日子 2009/04/20我的生活google, 互联网, 技巧, 生活, 美国igotit 想写这篇，一方面是因为曾经在atlanta机场熬过好几个通宵，但另一方面也是因为看到一篇《在杭州机场免费上网》的文章。其实还没看正文，就大概猜出是怎么回事了，因为我曾经在atlanta的hartsfield-jackson机场也发现过相似的漏洞，而且也正是找google帮的忙。 记得有一次是要乘坐一早的航班，大概是7点的吧，所以头天晚上就到了机场。刚开始机场里人还是很多，可能是晚上到港的航班还比较多，慢慢的人就越来越少了，人基本上集中在了机场内的一个大厅。那个大厅本来有不少沙发，但因为没经验，没提前抢，很早就一个也没了。不少人都是和我一样，为了省钱，不去住机场附近的旅馆，而是就在机场里的沙发上凑合一宿。 因为早准备要苦熬一夜了，也没打算睡觉，找人家打了烊的餐厅借了把椅子，打开我的t60，开始一集集地播放准备好的《friends》。可是放久了，看疲了，也想干点别的提精神的啊。于是打开winkawaks，打打97，玩玩metal slug。没多久也快顶不过困意了。 怎么办？要是能上网就好了。atlanta的机场倒是有无线网络可用，而且信号很好，可是连上一看，并没有免费的可用。虽然有几家不同的公司提供服务，但基本上价格都在7~8 usd/day。想想天亮也就几个小时的事情了，花掉这钱可真是不甘心啊。 于是无聊地开始逛机场的网站。反正当时是把那个网站全翻了一遍，不停地查航班什么的。就在无意间，突然发现google的主页居然可以打开。要知道访问别的页面的时候，都会全部自动跳回机场的主页，要求你购买internet access。打开google主页也就罢，发现还真可以搜索，但再一点搜索结果，就不行了，重新跳回机场主页。 要是能免费上google，对于我这个重度google产品使用者来说，和能上网不是一回事吗，大喜过望。马上输入gmail.com，正在欣喜，居然跳回了机场主页。晕，再输入mail.google.com，还是不行。原来gmail是不能直接访问的。再试google reader，也不行。明白了，原来只是让你搜索，这样搜到结果又总不能访问的时候，你还不终于决定买它个access啊。 正想放弃，又顺手把google的众多服务链接都点了下，意外发现google group可以打开，太好了，这不相当于可以上以海量记的论坛吗！虽然真正有趣的论坛在这的并不多，可是总算找了个突破口啊。接下来自然不用说，n爽。 故事到这还没完。脑子里火花飞转，既然可以用group，那就是可以用gmail啊！只要新建一个group，把要收信的人直接加为成员，在group里发个帖子，不就是给他/她发信了吗，而且对方还可以回信，回的信就在group里做为帖子显示了。而且group里添加成员的时候，还有联系簿的提醒，哈哈，完整了。 可惜那会儿还没有google apps engine，自然也没有gappproxy，不然也许真的就可以无限制上网了。 one comment so far posts navigation ← older posts 订阅rss recent posts 时间和距离 2016/04/14 「一阕清歌，唱彻琼楼晓」：清歌输入法v1.0发布 2013/10/25 七月时写的一段词 2013/10/20 打飞机：马化腾教我们的人生课

__label__low home pollyanna zamburlin contatti servizi press/video eventi blog nutrizione #cucineinsincrono link consigliati home pollyanna zamburlin contatti servizi press/video eventi blog nutrizione #cucineinsincrono link consigliati il diy per il tuo intestino homesenza categoriail diy per il tuo intestino previous next il diy per il tuo intestino ovvero come puoi capire da sola se il tuo intestino sta bene. ora se fino ad oggi non avete sentito parlare di microbioma, salute intestinale, probiotici o siete eremiti che vivono soli e senza connessione internet oppure non amate usare i social, aspetto che comprendo e approvo. comunque sia, sembra che nell’ultimo periodo buona parte della ricerca scientifica si stia focalizzando su cosa sia in grado di influenzare l’assetto del nostro microbioma, le prospettive sono interessanti ma consiglio sempre di accogliere tutto con senso critico e verificando (indico questo sito per chi mastica un po’ di scienza, inglese e di riviste di settore: ). ora, cercando di non dare nulla per scontato e volendo rivolgermi ad un pubblico ampio credo che sia mia dovere fornire una definizione di microbioma. wikipedia senza scomodarmi troppo ci dice che: il microbioma è l’insieme del patrimonio genetico e delle interazioni ambientali della totalità dei microrganismi di un ambiente definito. un ambiente definito potrebbe essere un intero organismo (per esempio, un essere umano) o parti di esso (per esempio, l’intestino o la cute). nel nostro intestino vivono popolazioni di batteri che in totale costituiscono un numero di cellule molto ma molto più numeroso di quelle che ci formano. avere le giuste popolazioni batteriche vuol dire riuscire a digerire in modo adeguato ciò che mangiamo e di conseguenza avere un intestino sano. un intestino sano è strettamente legato alla salute del nostro sistema immunitario e all’eventuale stato di infiammazione silente sistemica. e’ chiaro quindi perché tanto interesse nei confronti dell’intestino: implicazioni con malattie autoimmuni, implicazioni con malattie croniche, implicazioni con disbiosi importanti (come la sibo), implicazioni con infezioni come clostridium difficile o helycobacter pylori e via così. se soffrite di alcune di queste condizioni il mio miglior consiglio è quello di cercare un ottimo medico specialista e affidarvici, sono certa saprà indirizzarvi verso i test più adeguati, saprà elaborare una diagnosi e di conseguenza darvi le giuste indicazioni di stile di vita ed eventuale terapia da seguire. se invece volete solo farvi un’idea sulla salute del vostro intestino e se non siete schizzinosi posso darvi alcune indicazioni su come capire a casa se tutto procede per il meglio o se ci sono dei campanelli di allarme a cui iniziare a dare retta. scommetto vi starete chiedendo perché ho scritto che non dovete essere schizzinosi; la risposta è veramente semplice: bisogna fare attenzione alla nostra cacca. ecco perché possiamo continuare a parlare per ore ed orette della “salute intestinale”, del “giusto assetto del microbioma” ma sostanzialmente noi stiamo parlando di cacca. lo so che non è pertinente ma questo libro lo consiglio a tutte le mamme, è veramente utile soprattutto nella fase “togli il pannolino” quindi cosa possiamo controllare? la prima cosa che possiamo andare a controllare è il tempo di transito, vale a dire quanto tempo un cibo ci mette, dall’ingestione, a essere espulso sotto forma di feci. quindi è un test che ci aiuta a capire se c’è costipazione (quindi una flora batterica non equilibrata o una dieta povera in alimenti ricchi di fibra) o se il transito sia troppo veloce quindi se ci sia probabile malassorbimento del cibo. ma come posso ingerire un cibo e riconoscerlo nella cacca? semplice, vorrà dire che dovrò usare alimenti che possano essere riconosciuti per un motivo o per un altro. eccone due di facile reperibilità: semi di sesamo (da un cucchiaino ad un cucchiaio , mescolato in un bicchiere d’ acqua e inghiottito intero) barbabietole rosse (una tazza cotte o crude basta che vengano consumate da sole) come procedere: segnare l’ora dell’ingestione e controllare quando vengono espulsi: i semi non verranno digeriti quindi saranno visibili, la barbabietola colorerà le feci. un buon tempo di transito va dalle 12 alle 48 ore, tempi superiori alle 72 ore indicano costipazione. ricordate però che le donne hanno transiti in media più lenti mentre gli uomini più veloci; è altrettanto vero che alcuni cibi hanno un transito più veloce o lento di altri a secondo di quante fibre o quanta acqua contengono. la nostra velocità di transito può variare anche a seconda dell’introito di caffeina o alcol e di altri valori. quindi se potete ripetete questo test 3 volte in 3 momenti diversi della giornata per avere una media della vostra velocità di transito. la scala delle feci di bristol sempre da wikipedia (lo so sono pigra): la bristol stool scale o bristol stool chart o scala delle feci di bristol è uno strumento medico diagnostico, usato sia in ambito clinico sia sperimentale, creato allo scopo di classificare in categorie la forma e consistenza delle feci umane; la scala prevede sette categorie distinte. la forma e la consistenza delle feci dipendono con buona correlazione statistica dal tempo di permanenza delle stesse nel colon. i sette tipi di feci previste dalla scala sono: tipo 1: grumi duri separati tra loro, come noci/nocciole (difficili da espellere); dette anche feci caprine. possono essere dovute a mancanza di fibre nella dieta, disbiosi, cura antibiotica recente. tipo 2: a forma di salsiccia, ma formata da grumi uniti tra loro. può essere dovuta a ibs, emorroidi, ragadi. tipo 3: come un salame, ma con crepe sulla sua superficie. considerata morbida potrebbe però indicare una latente costipazione con problemi tipici del tipo 2. tipo 4: come una salsiccia o un serpente, liscia e morbida. ottima. tipo 5: pezzi separati morbidi con bordi come tagliati/spezzati; chiara (facile da evacuare). può essere considerata normale per alcune persone ma attenzione se riscontrate parti di cibo non digerite è sinonimo di incompleta digestione o di insufficiente quantità di fibra o di altri carboidrati che nutrono la flora intestinale. tipo 6: pezzi soffici/flocculari con bordi frastagliati, feci pastose. indica un transito troppo veloce compatibile con l’uso di lassativi, eccessivo stress o alcuni disordini intestinali. tipo 7: acquosa, nessun pezzo solido. completamente liquida. la classica diarrea che viene per influenza intestinale, intossicazione alimentare, irritazione intestinale o morbo di crohn. insomma diciamo che la tipologia 3, 4 o 5 non ci fa preoccupare mentre per le altre forse è il caso di rivolgersi a un medico specialista. ispezione visiva – presenza di cibo non digerito le cause possono essere diverse, non tutte devono farci preoccupare. quelle più probabili possono essere non aver masticato abbastanza, o aver ingerito grosse quantità di acqua mentre mangiavamo, aver mangiato troppo velocemente, aver consumato del cibo che non si digerisce facilmente (semi, noci, cereali, la buccia di alcuni frutti o di alcune verdure). ma il cibo non digerito, soprattutto se si tratta di alimenti che di norma vengono digeriti con facilità, suggerisce la presenza di un’infiammazione intestinale, un assorbimento incompleto, bassi livelli di acido cloridrico nello stomaco o bassa secrezione di enzimi da parte del pancreas per esempio. quindi in questo caso meglio rivolgersi a uno specialista. la checklist della salute intestinale un modo semplice per capire se abbiamo un disordine intestinale è controllare la presenza di quei sintomi che potrebbero indicarlo. di seguito fornisco una lista e se per caso riscontrate due o più sintomi allora forse è il caso di rivedere alcune delle vostre abitudini o di consultare uno specialista. gas , gonfiore e eruttazione dopo i pasti feci frequenti alvo alterno (stipsi e diarrea) cibo non digerito nelle feci indigestione e bruciore di stomaco alito cattivo sensibilità alimentare cronica muco nelle feci dolore o sforzo durante la defecazione quindi cosa fare se questi diy test ci dicono che il nostro intestino non è proprio in forma? ovviamente rivedere il nostro stile di vita (quanto beviamo, quanto camminiamo, quanto e come dormiamo, quanto siamo stressati), e il nostro regime alimentare. consumare più fibra potrebbe aiutare ma non è così scontato comunque vale la pena provare e vedere se fornendo più cibo al nostro microbioma sia sufficiente a sistemare un’eventuale disbiosi. se, invece, si sospetta qualcosa di più serio il mio invito è quello di consultare un professionista competente in grado di indirizzarvi verso i test più adeguati per fare innanzitutto la giusta diagnosi. citazioni parzialmente tradotto da: “bowel transit time.” nih u.s. national library of medicine: medlineplus. accessed april 20, 2016. degen lp & phillips sf. “variability of gastrointestinal transit in healthy women and men.” gut. 1996 aug;39(2):299-305. lewis sj & heaton kw. “stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time.” scand j gastroenterol. 1997 sep;32(9):920-4. rao ss, et al. “evaluation of gastrointestinal transit in clinical practice: position paper of the american and european neurogastroenterology and motility societies.” neurogastroenterol motil. 2011 jan;23(1):8-23. cabot health, bristol stool chart – cc by-sa 3.0, by pollyanna zamburlin|2016-08-21t18:08:42+00:00agosto 21st, 2016|senza categoria|0 comments share this story, choose your platform! about the author: pollyanna zamburlin related posts permalink gallery la “non-pizza” al cavolfiore permalink gallery nuovo servizio: nutrigenetica e dieta permalink gallery pancakes veloci per tutti! permalink gallery sesso, stress e donne permalink gallery la cellulite, la caffeina e il diy leave a comment annulla risposta 4 + = nove sede di genova presso centro delle scienze olistiche, in vico di san matteo 2/32 16145 genova tel.: (+39) 3937169856 sestri levante presso centro integrato salute via fascie 234 sestri levante 3937169856 articoli recenti una caloria è una caloria?

__label__low skip to main | skip to sidebar miércoles, 2 de julio de 2014 el sat de málaga visita a 14 trabajadores acampados en las puertas de una empresa de torremolinos j.p.j. (scotta) viernes 27 de junio de 2014. una delegación del sat territorial de málaga nos dirigimos a torremolinos. allí, en la puerta de unas oficinas de la empresa gamesa, se encuentran acampados 14 trabajadores despedidos de esta empresa. despedidos pero no humillados, despedidos pero no vencidos. aún me acuerdo del dicho que rezaba en una pancarta que apareció en la casa de la cultura de campillos el 29 de febrero de 1980: “pierde quien se rinde”. y lo recuerdo precisamente en momntos como estos. vivimos momentos difíciles, en los que tenemos que asistir a situaciones muy extremas, situaciones como la de gente que se vende por un puñado de higos o gente que prostituye su dignidad. para un trabajador, normalmente, heredero de un esclavo que sobrevivió, no hay más bajeza que perder su dignidad. puede estar la familia por encima de todo eso, puede haber más cosas cuando hablamos de un común o de un grupo, pero individualmente, el puntal más importante que sostiene el corazón de un trabajador es la dignidad, un trabajador que pierde su dignidad, retrocede diez o doce siglos atrás y pasa a ser un esclavo, una cosa, un arma en manos del poderoso. estamos en tiempos tan prietos, tan confusos, que, como en la fase de las tentaciones de los evangelios, el dios dinero, el dios mercado o el dios miedo que como en juno, son caras de un mismo cuerpo, ponen a prueba o tientan a los más debiles constantemente y los zarandean. cómo en un olivo apaleado, la mayoría cae al suelo, pero hay olivos que son de la estirpe de espartaco y resisten, reisten todos o en su mayoría. a veces resulta increible, pero en situaciones difíciles, los hombres y mujeres libres y dignas se elevan contra todas las miserias existentes en este sistema criminal y asesino: el sistema capitalista o neoliberal y luchan cuando luchar es la única forma de ser libres. en torremolinos, la dignidad personificada en 14 trabajadores, brilla con limpieza y se escenifica en dos o tres chambaos de tela, bajo el cual, concentran los víveres para resistir lo que haga falta. duermen en el suelo, en las aceras, al raso, buscando una mínima comodidad que nunca encuentran, pero cuando dicen a dormir duermen porque sus conciencias vigilan inmaculadas. no les dejaron montar tiendas de campaña. los asquerosos de las delelegaciones o subdelegaciones del gobierno, esos orondos meapilas, sátiros y enfermos de avaricia, no entienden de nada de esto, no saben, no sienten, pero prohiben, eso si lo saben hacer bien: prohibir, encadenar, inventar fronteras, maltratar a criaturas con sus normas y leyes. llamarle humanos a esta gente es insultar a la especie. todo trabas, todo impedimentos, incluso los imprevisibles del clima, pero estos trabajadores siguen allí y ya van 47 días, 48 a fecha de esta reflexión. reclamaron el cumplimiento del convenio, como sección sindical y eso no les gusta a las empresas, a las empresas les gusta la ley cuando esta les favorece, cuando no es así, piensan que se puede crear precedente y remover a l@s demás trabajador@s y contra eso ya lanzaron sus reformas laborales, con la espúrea intención de hacer desaparecer toda actividad sindical en los centros de trabajo. la empresa los echó por esta reclamación de sus derechos y en una de las primeras negociaciones sindicales, la empresa les ofreció el dinero que les pertenecía por sus servicios prestados según sus leyes. dispuestos a quitarse a los trabajadores de enmedio como fuera. pero ellos, los trabajadores, ya fueron dignos trabajando, cumpliendo e incluso regalando a la empresa, para revitalizarla y apuntalar su empleo, y las personas dignas trabajando suelen ser dignas también en la lucha y de eso no entienden los empresarios, ni su ratas. las empresas suelen ser máquinas dirigidas por seres con alma de máquinas, sólo entienden de beneficios y hoy día, auspiciadas y respaldadas por gobiernos y gobernantes sin escrúpulos del regimen titulado ppsoe, sólo buscan beneficios, prebendas y el mayor beneficio lo encuentran en la sustitución de trabajadores, para enclencar sueldos y cotizaciones de los nuevos. estos 14 trabajadores, de distintos pueblos de la provincia de málaga y sevilla, luchan por lo más honorable que puede luchar un trabajador que se precie de serlo: por su trabajo, su forma de ganarse la vida, pero también su forma de darse a los demás, porque sus manos y sus cuerpos no crean sólo riquezas para ellos y la empresa, como dice eduardo galeano: “el mundo lo construyeron los albañiles”, el mundo lo crean constantemente los trabajadores y el mundo no es de unos cuantos, el mundo es de todos, otra cosa es que unos cuantos se lo quieran apropiar o se lo apropien. quizás por esto y por lo insólito de su lucha, reciben constantemanete delegaciones de sindicatos (la semana que viene aparecerá por alli una delegación del sat nacional), delegaciones de partidos (poco antes de nosotros estuvieron los podemos de málaga) o grupos de amigos y paisanos que pasan la noche haciéndoles compañía. todo un derroche, también, de solidaridad. estos trabajadores, estarán en este rincón de torremolinos hasta el día 15 de julio. ese día se desplazaran a madrid, para asistir al juicio de los hechos. allí tendrán la ayuda y el apoyo que ellos crean conveniente y nuestro sindicato así se lo ha ofrecido, “para ustedes, todo lo que querais”. aquí, podiamos decir que necesitan apoyo, pero visto lo visto, lo que es necesario es que se les visite, pero para aprender de ellos, de su asamblearismo, de su dignidad y de su saber estar, y lo digo en singular porque son una piña o un ejemplo del que todo el mundo laboral tendría que aprender. durante esta semana que entra, una delegación del sat nacional, que es el máximo órgano de nuestro sindicato, los visitarán y volveremos a arroparlo, y yo, personalmente, me sentiré nuevamente orgulloso de que entre estos 14 trabajadores, se encuentre david bermudo, paisano mío de mi pueblo, de campillos, y llevando con orgullo su apellido, un apellido que también llevaba con honor mi abuela republicana. publicado por scotta en 7/02/2014 05:55:00 p. m. no hay comentarios:

последние демографические данные показывают, что в настоящее время мир претерпевает демографическую трансформацию: сегодня каждый десятый человек в мире - в возрасте 60 лет и старше, а по прогнозам к 2050-у уже каждый пятый человек будет в этом возрасте, - сказала в приветствии заместитель министра труда и социальной защиты населения рб татьяна глухова. -поэтому в рамках реализации стратегии действий в интересах граждан старшего поколения одной из задач является повышение качества жизни лиц старшего возраста с сохранением экономического, социального и интеллектуального долголетия. в заседании приняли участие депутат государственной думы павел качкаев, куратор проекта, депутат госсобрания – курултая рб рустем ахмадинуров, председатель федерации профсоюзов рб марат хусаинов, руководитель народного университета третьего возраста рафик хайдаров, представители профильных министерств и ведомств, а также около 400 активистов народного университета. в фойе дома профсоюзов гостей съезда встречала масштабная экспозиция работ слушателей третьего возраста в разных техниках: вязание, войлоковаляние, резьба по дереву, изготовление кукол и других. все желающие могли записаться на интересующие их курсы. - народный университет третьего возраста начинал работать по четырем направлениям: психология, медицина, садоводство и компьютерная грамотность. сегодня же у нас работает 55 клубов по интересам. все они сформированы на основе интересов наших слушателей, с учетом их пожеланий, - отметил рафик гильмиярович. по его словам, продолжает действовать проект «мобильный университет», на который был выделен грант президента россии. в течение года слушатели посетили более 15 районов и городов республики. - недавно открылся сибайский народный университет третьего возраста. у его слушателей - отличное здание, светлое и просторное. когда мне его показали, я был в восторге. спасибо за это главе попечительского совета сибайского филиала денису назарову, - отметил рафик хайдаров. сегодня «народный университет третьего возраста» стал уникальной площадкой, где люди почтенного возраста имеют возможность не только общаться, но и приобретать новые знания и умения, развивать свои таланты. по словам самих слушателей, после занятий в народном университете они чувствуют прилив сил и энергии, стали реже ходить в поликлиники, лучше понимают своих детей и внуков. на сегодняшний день в народный университет поступило свыше 450 заявок от желающих пройти курсы компьютерной грамотности. это наиболее популярное направление в работе университета. люди почтенного возраста также активно записываются на танцевальное и вокальное направления. в разработке университета сегодня находится социальный проект «бабушка на час», суть которого сводится к тому, что слушатели университета будут заниматься с детьми младшего школьного возраста, присматривать за ними, помогать с выполнением домашних заданий. как показали наблюдения и социальные исследования, эта услуга, которую слушатели народного университета хотят оказывать горожанам, весьма востребована. в современных семьях, где оба родителя работают до вечера, дети часто предоставлены сами себе. в таких условиях «бабушка на час», к тому же имеющая педагогическое образование, продолжительный трудовой стаж и колоссальный жизненный опыт, могла бы стать помощником семьи. проект предусматривает жесткий отбор желающих, их обучение и аттестацию. на сегодняшний день в проект подали заявки более тридцати слушателей университета третьего возраста. автор: лилия ларина просмотры: 703 теги: башкортостан народный университет третьего возраста денис назаров комментарии (0) добавить комментарий комментарий: ваше имя:* ваш email:* защита от роботов введите код с картинки:* все поля отмеченные * обязательны для заполнения рекомендуемые новости в башкирии женщина подозревается в убийстве своего новорожденного ребенка 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая пострадавшим в школе стерлитамака выплатят по 300 тысяч рублей 20 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина детский сад в башкирии стал рушиться спустя год после открытия 20 апреля 2018 андрей егоров в уфимский аэропорт вернули самолет с 42 пассажирами 20 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина в башкирии наградят учительницу, которая защищала учеников от одноклассника с ножом 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая сезон открыт: жители башкирии пострадали от первых укусов клещей 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая вопросы читателей proural, которые не прозвучали на прямой линии с рустэмом хамитовым 20 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина дождь, ветер, слабый гололед: прогноз погоды в башкирии на предстоящие выходные 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая фото дня паводок в поселке зубово под уфой общество пострадавшим в школе стерлитамака выплатят по 300 тысяч рублей 20 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина детский сад в башкирии стал рушиться спустя год после открытия 20 апреля 2018 андрей егоров в уфимский аэропорт вернули самолет с 42 пассажирами 20 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина в башкирии наградят учительницу, которая защищала учеников от одноклассника с ножом 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая сезон открыт: жители башкирии пострадали от первых укусов клещей 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая вопросы читателей proural, которые не прозвучали на прямой линии с рустэмом хамитовым 20 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина дождь, ветер, слабый гололед: прогноз погоды в башкирии на предстоящие выходные 20 апреля 2018 василиса миловицкая рустэм хамитов — о том, как не допустить в башкирии ситуации, аналогичной произошедшему в волоколамске 19 апреля 2018 мария акиньшина подписка получать подборку новостей на вашу почту новости детали вопросы читателей proural, которые не прозвучали на прямой линии с рустэмом хамитовым в уфимский аэропорт вернули самолет с 42 пассажирами в стерлитамакской школе после жуткой трагедии возобновились занятия «сюрпризы» от минэкологии башкирии по шиханам фоторепортажи самые жуткие бомбоубежища уфы — фоторепортаж proural толпы мигрантов на улице уфы пугают горожан: proural выяснил, в чем дело самые жуткие бомбоубежища уфы — фоторепортаж подписка получать подборку новостей на вашу почту новости новости партнеров «дело» «взгляд» рбк. стройконтроль рбк-уфа, программа время художников рбк-уфа, программа молоко -

items with coupons allowed-no more. also, no more overage at my store:(, the q doubles up to the actual price of the item only!! boohoo! jjandc so glad the peterpan pb is on sale.. been waiting for a good pb sale with coupons! bonus, it qualifies for the bilo fuel for school. 4 pb & 4 kellogs mini-wheats should be $4-5 oop after coupons and a $10 rebate. sweeeeeeeeeet. jenny that’s what i was thinking!!! kathryn @ m rose–10 same q’s been the bilo policy for quite a while. one of the head cashiers at my bilo is also an avid couponer, and told me that if i had more than 10 to run them as a separate transaction. that has worked for me. michelle in georgia i couldn’t get the peanut butter q or the cereal q to print. angie jenny, i tried to get these meals last week and the best price i found was $7.99, not 3.99 as advertised here. am i looking for the wrong thing? they were frozen meal kits? wanchai ferry kits $3.99 ea angie i am having an awful time getting the smart source qs to print from my office. i have left the window open for over an hour and nothing. it takes forever at home too, but they do eventually print. i even went in and put that address in my trusted sites list, but no luck. am i doing something wrong? any ideas? lindsay i can’t get the keebler qs to print..says there’s a error and to try back later.. haley do you think there is a way to do both the kellogg and bilo fuel for school in the same transaction? i.e, am i not going to be able to do one offer because i have to send the receipt in for another? all i know so far is that the kelloggs fuel for school rebate does require you to send in the receipt, upcs, and rebate form. but, all the bilo website says is that there is a mail in rebate form that will be printed with my transaction…has anyone used the bilo fuel for school and/or know if i have to send in the receipt and upcs for the bilo one too? beth where is the “free (1) crayola 24 ct. crayons wyb (1) peter pan peanut butter august all you” located in the magazine. i looked through mine and couldn’t find it. thanks! kristie i found a .55/1 pop tarts coupon from the 6/7 rp expires 8/2 ricky the only way i could get peanut butter to print was from the ie not from firefix. go figure angelathecouponnerd angie – the wanchai ferry kits were a shelf item – rice, sauce, peppers and peanuts – for $3.99. they had romano’s macaroni grill meal kits on clearance as well as soleil razors at a columbia sc bi-lo. mandie i too cannot get the keebler q’s to print, keep getting an error page.. gina anyone know if the catalina deal is $15 before or after coupons? no one at bi-lo seems to know… sam for the peter pan and the 5 dollars on your next order…i am assuming that in order to qualify for the 15 they are taking the 1/2 off price and counting it towards the total…not the full price, right? i just don’t want to have to spend more than i have to if they are not counting the bogo price. susan is peter pan part of fuel for school? (comment# 2) i see it in the conagra deal. all these deals and rebates are running together in my mind (lol). jjandc thanks susan & oops! on the peterpan pb, that item isn’t part of the bi-lo “fuel” rebate. guess i’ll have to substitute poptarts…aww, my kids’ll be so sad. yes, it’s the conagra. looks like there’s some chef boyardee in our future :@) teresa does anyone know if you can do more than one bilo fuel for school rebate? tracy beth, i just bought the august all you mag and the coupon was in the insert of coupons that comes in the middle of the mag. for some reason, they are not always inside every one. hope this helps :) amy quick, crazy question. if i have a buy 3 get one free coupon for the chef boyardee can i use a dollar off coupon as well?? angie thanks couponnerd. :-) i’ll check on the shelf. angie amy b. i found a tearpad near the deli cheeses for $1 off any presidente. went very well with the b1g2 free presidente brie! 3 for $3.99. now i just need to find some cheap (good) wine to go with it! buffy gina – i did the $15.00 hunt’s deal last week at my bi-lo – and the 15.00 was before coupons – so i was able to use my coupons and get an awesome deal!!! suzanne i think the conagra deal is working on pre- b1g1 prices. i bought 2 peanut butters, 1 bag of banquet frozen chicken, 1 hewbrew national franks (total before discounts would be 14.33) and i got a $5 oyno catalina. wait it might be because i originaly had 2 hunt’s snack puddings on my order but i had the cashier void them off when i realized my q would not work on them. not sure what is going on- but i was happy. love my little ol’ pelzer, sc bilo! suzanne i just realized my peter pan q did not double. oh well, .79 cents each is still good. m rose my bi-lo had tons of clearance laundry items tonight!!!!! downy-tide-snuggle-bounce-spraynwash gel!!! yipppeee!!!! now to find more shelves…… jen l i have the same questions as haley in #9. do you think there is a way to do both the kellogg and bilo fuel for school in the same transaction? i.e, am i not going to be able to do one offer because i have to send the receipt in for another? all i know so far is that the kelloggs fuel for school rebate does require you to send in the receipt, upcs, and rebate form. but, all the bilo website says is that there is a mail in rebate form that will be printed with my transaction…has anyone used the bilo fuel for school and/or know if i have to send in the receipt and upcs for the bilo one too? bobbi jo hello ladies, i have been having trouble getting the brick coupons to print…. for instance: keebler sandies and keebler fudge shoppe cookies. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. (i had this problem last week for another item.) an error screen comes up and tells me to come back later? any idea?????? thank you!!! deborah i can’t get the curel coupon to print. it keeps telling me i’ve already printed this coupon the number of times allowed. but i know i’ve never printed this coupon. does that mean the print limit has been reached in general for this coupon? this has been happening on all the bricks coupons i’ve encountered lately. kristie pop tarts deal above.. i dont know about other bi-lo’s, but the ones in aiken, lexington & columbia the costs are as follows.. for the 8 pk they are $2.29 each, and for the 12 pk they are 3/$8.00.. above it is listed that the boxes of the 8 pk are $.64 after coupon, but that is not the case in the stores i have checked. brenda mentos gum is on sale for $.99 at the registers. this makes it free with your .55 coupon. allison kristie, i just got back from bilo, and yes, the poptarts on sale were the 12 pack. i was still able to get the sh brand 6pk for free, though. question for anyone: i bought 4 kellogs mini wheats, 2 boxes of pop tarts, and 2 eggo waffles. i did not get the bilo fuel rebate info on/with my receipt. anyone else have that problem? can i go to their website and request it anyway? thanks! heather angie #7: sometimes it depends on how the printer is set up…it works differently if you set it up to print right from the computer, or to put the pages in order (polling?) -this takes forever on slower speed computers and even can be cancelled if you move to another screen or if your computer goes to sleep. i’m not a computer expert, but my hubby has helped me to print faster and more reliably by changing printer settings (control panel, printers & faxes, choose printer, edit settings) if you are semi- or not computer savvy, you may want to get help so that your printer doesn’t freak out on you. :0) have fun! jon the $15 dollar deal is after bonuscard discounts and before coupons, i did it yesterday with 4 peanut butter and 6 chef b and only got $3 back… today i did it with 7 peanut butter and 7 chef b and got the $5 kathi just so you know the conagra $5 off coupon worked for me prior to swiping my bilo card or coupons so i got my $5 catalina for 3 jars of peanut butter (on bogo and i had 2 .50 off qs which doubled) and 2 boxes of popcorn)–cost to me after bilo bonus card and coupons $5.55 and i got a coupon for $5 off my next order. if i’d had another peanut butter coupon it would’ve been a money maker. i held on to my bonus card until everything was scanned so may that mattered? emily wylie i have looked through the aug. all you forward and backwards (literally) and can’t find the free crayon coupon…. what am i missing!!! emily wylie nevermind… i just saw it answered above:) sherry m i’ve seen different “fixes” for printing problems but don’t see how to fix mine. i’m trying to print the conagra coupons and the green dot just keeps spinning. the link is what part of that am i supposed to change to be able to print? anybody know? thanks! terry you can do both programs if you ask the cashier to print a second reciept. they did it for me. sam from what i can tell the 15 in conagra is pre sale prices…i bought 5 pb, 1 chef boyardee and 3 snack packs, came to 2.63 after coupons and the 5 dollar catalina printed! my calculations did not add up to 15 dollars with the sale prices (so i thought i would at least shoot for the 3) m rose good booklets at my bi-lo…..nabisco save $55.00 throughout the school year and a fuel for school!!! tonya my bi-lo refused two of my printed coupons because they were a little faded and the manager couldn’t tell if they were a copy. has anyone else had this problem? the manager said that their inventory was really bad because of people misusing coupons and that they can refuse to accept a coupon if they want. jenny (also) the bi-lo fuel for school does not require your receipt, so you can do both rebates at one time. the manager explained to me that they track it with your bonuscard and the catalina somehow? hope this helps! lynn sherry m – i’ve read that you have to turn on your pop ups? but i’ve never been able to print anything from smartsource. even when i turn it off. it’s too bad because they have some good coupons but for some reason, i can’t seem to make it work. maybe someone else can help us? lynn heather #34 i got up to the “edit settings” and didn’t know what to do then. what do you edit? thanks for any help. seacoastmom i think the bilo on bacon’s bridge (summerville, sc) is calculating the conagra deal on the regular prices this morning i got 3 pp pb’s regular 2.70 3 chef boyardee regular 4/$5 1 banquet chicken strips regular 4.99 and i did get the $5off/next purchase catalina print i had a couple of store brand items that wouldn’t have counted and with the sale prices the qualifying items would only have been $11.68 before coupons. hth jodi i just went to my bi-lo and the betty crocker fruit snacks were $2.72 b1g1 so with coupon it was .96 cents. just an fyi for some of you. i go to the one in travelers rest in s.c. maureen what is the catalina? i’m new to all of this. thanks for any help seacoastmom jodi- a catalina is a coupon that prints out from the register (or a little printer near the register) that gives you a certain $off your next purchase. i also had no idea what it was at first and thought it was a store brand or maybe a salad dressing, for almost 2 mos! there is a link on the top right that says “understand the lingo” that takes you to this page: lots of good info there, there’s definately a learning curve :@) seacoastmom oops, i meant maureen! amy quick, crazy question. if i have a buy 3 get one free coupon for the chef boyardee can i use a dollar off coupon as well?? allison jenny, how do i do the rebate without the receipt? is it automatic based on the bilo card or do i go to the website? thanks! tracy my bi-lo in boiling springs sc does not have the clear value milk for $1.99. i wonder why? elizabeth sherry m.~ i have had the same problem using mozilla firefox browser. what solved it for me was to go under “tools,” then “option,” and then under the “contents” tab click on the “exceptions” button under “block pop up windows.” then type in the name of the site offering the coupons (i.e “postcereals.com” not “smartsource . . . “). hope that helps! if not, try a different browser. internet explorer works sometimes for me if mozilla doesn’t. cat can you use a 5 dollar catalina on a second 15 purchase and get the $5off/next purchase catalina to print out jamie cat- yes, i’ve done this before on different bi-lo catalina deals, and it went fine. everyone else: if you can find specially-marked kelloggs “5 savings inside” cereal boxes in your bi-lo, open them up and use the coupons inside to purchase them. pair that with food lion $1 off kelloggs (if your bi-lo takes competitor coupons, many of our chattanooga-area ones do!) this will make your cereal free. buy 8, the $10 kelloggs/bi-lo back-to-school cash rebate will print out. buy 10, not only will you get a $10 cash card from the bi-lo promo, but you can send in for the fuel for school rebate too! need that extra receipt? just ask the cashier to double-print it. $20, 10 boxes of cereal, totally free! jamie chattanoogacheapskate.com melissa my bi-lo didn’t have the milk on sale :( i asked the manager and she said it never was on sale or in their sales paper. kathi my bilo (17 a in summerville sc) had coupons with the hillshire farm lunch meat to get a free loaf of sara lee bread wyp of lunch meat–w/ 2 coupons (.35 ea and doubled and the bread q’s) i got 2 packages of lunch meat and 2 loaves of bread for $5.20 heather i just got back from the bilo in lexington & nothing printed on my receipt for the “fuel for school.” am i missing something??? also, on a side end cap across from the pop tarts they had a stack of pop-tarts that were 2/$4 & it was a pack of 12. they only had strawberry & brown sugar but these boxes also had a coupon on the back for $1. i bought these instead of the 3/$8…not that worried about variety. tina anyone else having problems with the peanut butter coupon not doubling? denise my pb q’s doubled? liz what about blooms grocery store??? this week until tuesday august 4th they have triple coupons!!!!! they do have some restrictions, most are like bi-lo coupons restrictions. we need a blooms link since they are popping up in the south. 3 have opemed up within a 20 mile radious of where i live in the past 2 years. i live in a rural area surrounded by growing areas. fyi—blooms has triple coupons once a month. usually in the 3rd or 4th week. :) linda the peter pan coupon is no longer available. where can i get another one. amy today’s smartsource had a 50 off of 2 .. which would make it .74 each instead of .24! seacoastmom if you go to my.bi-lo.com (you have to log in) there is a $0.75 coupon off a southern home pb. good thru 8/28! sherri does anybody know if bi-lo accepts expired coupons? kathi cat i have gotten 2 conagra $5 off vouchers. you have to purchase in 2 separate transactions but it does work sheri how out of date? i have put coupons up to a week expired in the stack w/ the rest of my coupons and they have scanned wonderfully but i was fully prepared to be a gracious shopper and apologize for my “error” all i had a great day today since 3 of the bilo employees actually asked for my input as to how they could coupon shop more effectively! since i am morally opposed to walmart and there is no other really geographically great alternative for us that made me happy. i will shop food lion or pig if they have a deal that makes it worthwhile going out of my way but it is validating to have the store employees realize that w/ a little effort it is quite doable to skip walmart. janice i went to bi-lo this morning and bought 2 eggo waffles and some other items for the bi-lo fuel for school rebate. i did not get a $2 catalina for fruit. how do i get that? i have looked all over the bi-lo website and can’t seem to find that deal. jenny (also) for those of you who were not able to get the peanut butter coupon to print, there is actually another deal that will work with coupons from sunday’s paper. there were coupons for .50 off 2 jars. so, if you go buy 6 jars of p.b., and use 3 coupons, it will cost you 5.97, and you will get a 5.00 catalina back. if you have enough coupons, you can “roll” this deal, and get 12 jars of peanut butter for for 6.94, with a 5.00 off catalina left, basically making it 1.94 for 12 jars of peanut butter!!! i just tried it at my bi-lo in cleveland, tn, and it worked! kathi i got a little notice that printed out today saying that starting on weds this week and running for the next 2 weeks that if you purchase $100 in gift cards you get a bilo voucher for $20. does anyone know if this includes bilo gift cards? wondering because i have been using the envelope method but was seriously thinking about using bilo gift cards (purchase 9 $50 giftcards for $450 and get one free). i have been putting cash back for any catalina i spend this month in order to be able to afford $450 at one time for groceries–obviously not to spend all at once). anyway, i have $30 saved already toward that and i am thinking that another $40 from this month (which i am going to wind up spending $200 at bilo anyway) would make the $450 do-able trish kathi, on the regular promotion for the buy $500 in gc’s get a bl gift card, bl gift cards are excluded :( lets hope for the other though.. lenka kathi you can buy giftcards to gasstation like bp or shell. buy 4 for $25 and get $20 next purchase. is good deal if you have these gastation around. lenka kathi my bilo has lots of different store’s gift cards! as of this morning the $20 off of your next order was not printing w/ the purchase of a gift card but because i had the little flyer that printed out from the register the store manager gave me and the other woman who bought $100 in gift cards each a “rain check” for $20 (this is not the “correct” way to handle it. but since we were shopping in that store at that time it will give them a chance to get it straight w/ their corporate office and i was ok w/ this) the good news is he says as near as he can tell we can buy bilo gift cards and get the same $20 (wow!

__label__low leifs mat jag skriver lite löst om mat. lite som om vi fikade ihop och jag berättar om gårdagens äventyr i köket. till vardags programmerar jag. jag skriver mest om mat jag gjort som var intressant på något vis. något rolig råvara, en spännande idé, som fungerade eller något misslyckande som någon kanske kan lära sig av. jag skriver inte om all mat jag lagar, bara den som blir en bra historia. 2009-06-21 elgrillen på balkongen elgrillen har sina tydliga nackdelar. den har låg effekt (2kw) så man kan inte grilla en blodig biff. jag har provat. det blir en biff som är grå både på ytan och inuti. eftersom man inte eldar något, blir det ingen god röksmak på maten. röksmaken kan man delvis kompensera med "rök på flaska". jag har också fått tips om att låta en kvist färsk rosmarin rostas bredvid maten ska fungera, ska prova vid tillfälle. elgrillen har sina riktiga fördelar också, den kan hålla konstant värme länge, länge. så all mat som ska långsam-grillas fungerar bra. till lunch idag hade jag kvar ett paket av den industitillverkade italienska salsiccian. och den skulle grillas. jag penslade på en blandning av rökarom, svartvinbärssaft (smak och socker) och fisksås (smak och salt). sen på grillen. efter en stund fick korven sällskap av ett par långsmala paprikor (sådanna som säljs som "turkisk paprika"). sa jag att gillen är långsam? det var bara att sitta där på balkongen, i solen och vänta. varje kvart, sådär, penslade jag på mer vätska. sen fick man läsa bok och vänta igen. efter en knapp timme såg korven bra ut, så det blev lunch. paprikan hade nog blivit bättre om de hade varit en varmare grill, nu var den egentligen kokt. fast det var gott, det med. /l posted by leif lundgren at 16:31 reactions: skicka med e-postblogthis!dela på twitterdela på facebookdela på pinterest labels: elgrill, korv inga kommentarer: skicka en kommentar senaste inlägg äldre inlägg startsida prenumerera på: kommentarer till inlägget (atom) prenumerera? inlägg atom inlägg kommentarer atom kommentarer sök leifsmat twitter andra bra bloggar gittos mat pärs brödbakslogg pain de martin bloggarkiv ► 2018 (1) ► mars (1) ► 2017 (1) ► oktober (1) ► 2016 (1) ► december (1) ► 2014 (1) ► augusti (1) ► 2013 (6) ► november (2) ► april (2) ► mars (1) ► februari (1) ► 2012 (8) ► december (1) ► juli (1) ► juni (2) ► maj (2) ► april (2) ► 2011 (18) ► december (2) ► november (1) ► oktober (2) ► augusti (3) ► juli (1) ► maj (3) ► april (2) ► mars (2) ► januari (2) ► 2010 (53) ► december (4) ► november (4) ► oktober (2) ► september (3) ► augusti (7) ► juli (5) ► juni (1) ► maj (1) ► april (6) ► mars (5) ► februari (7) ► januari (8) ▼ 2009 (65) ► december (13) ► november (5) ► oktober (4) ► september (4) ► augusti (1) ► juli (3) ▼ juni (9) riktig tomatsås fräsh sommarpasta varma dagar, sval sallad elgrillen på balkongen grillad, nej rökt lax brassato på svagdricka och rotselleri. lättlagad ugnskorv omelette med tomat och ost pyttipanna på salsiccia och rotselleri ► maj (3) ► april (8) ► mars (7) ► februari (2) ► januari (6) ► 2008 (71) ► december (6) ► november (1) ► oktober (4) ► september (10) ► augusti (10) ► juli (10) ► juni (11) ► maj (4) ► april (10) ► mars (4) ► februari (1) etiketter bröd (20) korv (14) taylors and jones (12) pasta (11) långkok (10) revbensspjäll (10) äggröra (7) brasato (6) grilling (6) kyckling (6) elgrill (5) gotland (5) omelette (5) saffran (5) surdeg (5) svamp (5) brunch (4) pizza (4) trattkantareller (4) vitkål (4) bräserad (3) köttbullar (3) köttfärs (3) misslyckanden (3) räkor (3) salciccia (3) thai (3) alpmat (2) bok (2) choritzo (2) fryst (2) gnocchi (2) hamburgare (2) italien (2) kantareller (2) kräftor (2) redskap (2) rinnig deg (2) spätzle (2) sufflé (2) tomatsås (2) torkad svamp (2) våfflor (2) zucchini (2) ägg (2) "bill buford" (1) aioli (1) apelsinmarmelad (1) autolys (1) baguette (1) baguettplåt (1) biscotti (1) blodpudding (1) blåmusslor (1) bondens matbod (1) böcker (1) curry (1) dillkött (1) drickchoklad (1) edamer (1) fabrique (1) frikadeller (1) grissini (1) gryta (1) grönkål (1) hummus (1) högrev (1) jens linder (1) julost (1) kaffirlime (1) klyftpotatis (1) kniv (1) koka nudlar (1) kryddor (1) köttfärssås lamm (1) lamm (1) lax (1) makrill (1) manitoba cream (1) marmelad (1) meta (1) micro (1) microvågsugn (1) morötter (1) musslor (1) nordafrikanskt (1) pannkaka (1) pasta carbonara galangal (1) pastasallad (1) piroger (1) polenta (1) potatis (1) potatisbakelse (1) prinskorv (1) pyttipanna (1) resturang (1) rosmarin (1) rotselleri (1) rådjur (1) rådjursköttfärs (1) sardeller (1) soppa (1) spisäventyr (1) stekt ris (1) studiebesök (1) sötpotatis (1) tastecasting (1) varma mackor (1) verktyg (1) vit sparris (1) älgfärs (1) älgköttfärs (1) äppelvin (1) amazon contextual product ads temat vattenstämpel. använder blogger.

__label__low home crea antes y después diy reciclar descubre inspiración recomendaciones mira arte fotografía diseño libros vive decoración planes viajes / sobre mi contacto arte yulia brodskaya. arte en papel 14 febrero, 2018 ya os había hablado antes en el blog de la técnica de filigrana en papel e incluso me anime con un pequeño tutorial. pero sin dudarlo ni un segundo, lo que hace yulia brodskaya son palabras mayores. es arte en mayúsculas. ilustradora gráfica de profesión, yulia siempre había estado enamorada del dibujo y del papel. pero no empezó a verlo con otros ojos, hasta que un día, como forma de promocionar su trabajo, decidió crear su nombre en filigrana. en ese momento algo hizo click en su cabeza. acabo tan enganchada que siguió experimentando hasta que finalmente abandonó el ordenador por el papel. ahora es una reputada artista que trabaja para grandes marcas, revistas o creando portadas para libros. este trabajo más comercial lo complementa con proyectos más artísticos, sin duda los más impresionantes. si hay un trabajo que me ha dejado sin palabras, ese ha sido sin duda la serie de retratos de ancianos. los empezó como una forma de explorar las posibilidades que ofrecía la técnica de filigrana y a la vez superar las limitaciones que tiene. pero con ellos ha alcanzado otro nivel y consigue trasmitir toda la sabiduría que se acumula en cada pliegue de la cara con los años. “estoy fascinada de como toda la vida de una persona queda escrita en su cara” – yulia brodskaya en su web explica que siempre comienza a trabajar con un esquema bien detallado de lo que quiere crear, y es que una vez que entra el pegamento en juego ya no hay marcha atrás. no hay prisas. no hay trampa ni cartón. si no muchas horas de trabajo, paciencia y cuidado para ir dando forma poco a poco a cada una de las ilustraciones. dependiendo de la dificultad y del tamaño final, puede tardar desde un par de días a varias semanas o meses hasta que coloca la última pieza de papel. viendo el resultado esta claro que es todo un trabajazo. elegir solo unas pocas imágenes para enseñaros por aquí me ha costado lo suyo. por eso, si os ha quedado ganas de más, os recomiendo que os deis una vuelta por su web para ver su portafolio. en su cuenta de instagram también va mostrando el día a día de su trabajo. ¿qué os ha parecido?

__label__low skip to main | skip to sidebar wednesday, august 31, 2016 fever free, a little tense but cuddly reagan was being vocal and woke me up around 5:30am this morning. i think she was calling me to come clean her up! the leaky poos strike again. i changed her, and thankfully had put a pad under her last night that i was able to easily remove, and tucked her back into bed. we all fell back to sleep. she woke up around 7:30 being super sweet again. shortly thereafter there was poo number two. still very watery...looks almost like it has bits of blueberry or spinach in it (tmi?). what have you been eating reagan?? no nurse today so it was just me and the kids. i got ryan off to school (thankfully a friend was able to take him) and then reagan and i just hung out. her speech therapist came at 10 and worked on her computer. it wasn't until 10:30 that i realized that i had yet to start giving her her meds! oops. definitely not a good nurse. she got them all and then we spent some time cuddling on the sofa this afternoon. she was getting a little agitated (i think her tummy was hurting) but as soon as i held her she settled down and fell asleep. grandpa picked ryan up from school and then took him to therapy. reagan eventually woke up and was calm again. tonight she did have another incident where she seemed a little tense and was getting close to tears, but i held her and then she dozed off in my arms! sweet girl. hoping she feels better tomorrow. today was her first fever free day! 0 comments tuesday, august 30, 2016 sweet sick girl reagan slept well last night but woke up with a low grade fever and another big poo this morning. she's been in good spirits, just full of poo! all therapies were canceled so we decided to go on a long walk. a loooooong walk through the neighborhood (2.24miles). reagan was great, but her nurse and i were both sweaty by the time we got back! she's been super sweet all day today (another 4 poo day). we didn't give her any fever reducer so we could keep an eye on it to see where it was headed. all day it was hovering at 99-100, but this afternoon it went back up to 102. we gave her some tylenol and then it was gone. hopefully for good (it didn't go back up at all so fingers crossed)! she's been super precious tonight and dozed off pretty early. hoping she gets some good sleep and wakes up feeling much improved in the morning. 0 comments monday, august 29, 2016 oh no...not a fever!?!? reagan has had a bit of a strange day today! she slept well last night but woke up with a very stinky poopy diaper this morning (we don’t even remember the last time she went on her own)! we had just finished cleaning her up and changing her when it was already time for speech! she was a little wide eyed but she seemed fine. she made it about 30min into speech when all of a sudden she broke out into tears! we’re not sure what it was, but i picked her up and held her and that eventually calmed her down. we decided to just skip the rest of speech and her nurse and i took her for a walk through the neighborhood. she was great for the walk, a little vocal at times, but i think she was just talking to us. we were home only minutes when she had another big poo! thank you for waiting reagan! this was perfect timing for her bath, so we immediately threw her in the tub for a thorough cleaning! the rest of the afternoon she dozed a lot. she was kinda moany/vocalizing half awake/half asleep the whole time. then about 30min before our nurse was due to leave, she thought reagan felt a bit warm. she took her temp and it was reading 102-103! she thought surely there was something off with the thermometer, but we changed the batteries and checked everyone else, and reagan’s temp was still very high. we gave her some acetaminophen and her temp was down within 30min. it was at this point that i realized i needed to notify her pregnant nurse scheduled to work tomorrow. we really don’t want to expose her to anything, so thankfully our new nurse offered to pick up her shift if we needed her. yes, yes we do! tonight she was good but did have two more stinky poo diapers. it’s not completely unusual for her to have a day where she poos 3-4 times, she used to do it once a week or so, but it’s been a while since we’ve seen one of those days and the fact that they’re a little mucousy and we’re also seeing a fever makes me think something is definitely going on. ryan had a cough last week (and still has it) but no other symptoms. ugh. i hate to think he’s already getting his sister sick after only one week of school! she was good the rest of the night and ended up dozing off on the floor and making sweet little noises here and there (even though her eyes were still closed). precious girl. i hope she can sleep tonight and wakes up feeling better in the morning! 1 comments sunday, august 28, 2016 sleep the day away today was a sleepy day for my girl. seriously sleepy. she slept the entire day, never waking up once. it wasn't until tonight when she had a big leaky diaper that i finally moved her out of her bed so that i could change everything out. and no...she didn't wake up. not even for a second. she was out. we moved her back to her bed and she's still fast asleep, so i think we're all going to get a good night's sleep tonight! happy that my girl got some much needed rest but hope to see that sweet smile tomorrow! 0 comments saturday, august 27, 2016 serious, sensitive, then sleepy! sleep wasn't great again last night, and then to top it off, my girl was quite serious this morning. she's had an ok day today. we've had to be careful with talking around her, but she's been otherwise ok. this afternoon she was a little sensitive and getting increasingly vocal (like she might cry any minute), so i picked her up and held her and she immediately fell asleep on my lap. i held her for at least two hours until i had to get up and then i switched places with daddy who then held her for another good while. eventually i took her back again and held her until daddy finally took her up to bed. originally she seemed to be sleeping lightly, but she's out out now so i think she will finally get that good night's sleep we've been waiting for! 0 comments friday, august 26, 2016 eyegaze and afo appts reagan woke up again last night at exactly the same time as she did last night. right around 1:45am she was vocal and not wanting to stay in her bed. i moved her to her chair where i "think" she dozed back off for a bit, but every now and then i'd here her vocalize so i know she wasn't sleeping too soundly. she did get pretty vocal again right around 5:15 before my run and this time i thought she might actually cry. i gave her a dose of oxycodone and she dozed back off. that didn't last long though, she was back awake by 6:45am and her brother was up shortly thereafter! ryan woke up with a nice gunky cough this morning. less than a week in school and he's already bringing home the sickies. even with her little bout of craziness this morning, reagan has actually turned out to have a really great day! she was pretty sensitive this morning when it came to us talking, which made things a little difficult at first during speech when we had the eyegaze rep out to help adjust reagan's mounts. she seemed to mellow out though and we were able to get some good referrals and ideas on things we need to do with her computer. we only had about 30 min to then get ready and out the door for her afo appt. unfortunately it was just a talking appt and no doing (although she was a super star tolerating all of the stretching). we'll have to go back to have her recast. her current afos are just "too aggressive" requiring her to stretch more than she's even capable of at this point, causing her left foot to turn in to try and compensate. so for this next pair we will try get her in on a fairly high tone day, so we know we're being realistic when it comes to stretching and we end up with a final product that she can actually spend more time in (and with her feet in the proper position). we came home and found ryan and grandpa swimming in the pool. we kept reagan downstairs and just spent the rest of the afternoon lounging in the living room. she's been a lot more calm and laid back this afternoon/tonight. happy just rolling around on the floor. sweet girl, i sure hope she sleeps better tonight! having fun playing ballerina! she's definitely got the toe point down! 0 comments thursday, august 25, 2016 sweet, vocal, and a little kooky reagan woke up around 1:45am super vocal and didn't go back to sleep. she's still been super happy and super vocal today, a little kooky, but sweet. she had both pt and ot today and did well with both. everyone is loving this sweet darling girl this week. tonight she was very vocal and a little twitchy. she kept stiffening out as she was trying to fall asleep. daddy laid down with her and she was dozing off but every time he tried to get up, she'd wake back up and start vocalizing. ugh. go to sleep silly girl!wow! another huge difference in just a year! 💗 0 comments wednesday, august 24, 2016 another tooth lost! reagan had another great day today. she slept well last night, that is until 4:30am or so, when she decided it was time to get up! she's been super sweet, super smiley, and vocal today. and another shocker...she lost another tooth this morning! her upper right canine...we didn't even know it was loose! her nurse just looked at her and saw it sitting on her tongue! so crazy. the new tooth isn't out yet, just gums, but it didn't even bleed that much (it must've been really loose). no therapies this morning, we had actually canceled speech on account of an orthotic appt that was rescheduled. instead we took a nice little walk. another 1.34 miles to our log (2.88 miles total). it was a little warm but windy so it wasn't too bad. this afternoon she had another session of school and vision came along. she did well with everything. what can i say, she's been a wonderful girl this week! tonight she gave us a little grief going to bed again. hoping we all get some sleep. 0 comments tuesday, august 23, 2016 finally lost her tooth reagan slept well last night and woke up once again super sweet and adorable! while i was at speech with ryan this morning, she lost her tooth! the tooth that's been hanging in there forever, refusing to come out even though the permanent tooth is already completely in, yeah that tooth. it finally just came out while she was getting her teeth brushed this morning! we were all so excited! she's had another great day today. she had both pt and ot and did great with both! she's been just so sweet and so super smiley, just a joy to be around. love this girl! her hips have been a little poppy lately, something we need to keep an eye on. during pt she even seemed to wince once when it popped, but then seemed fine. we typically check them via x-ray once a year but i think we usually do that in october. we'll see. if we see any more wincing, then we might need to move it up. tonight she still was an angel, but didn't fall asleep on her own like she's been doing lately. i'm hoping she sleeps, but who knows. 0 comments monday, august 22, 2016 awesome first day of school reagan had another great day today. i heard her vocalizing when i got back from my run and i was a little afraid she might not be happy. but when i walked in and peeked over the side of her bed, i found the sweetest, most smiley girl ever! she has been ridiculously wonderful all day today. she had a busy day of therapies. speech this morning and then ot and school this afternoon! she was awesome for everything. what a great first day of school. her brother had a good day too, much to my relief! this afternoon we took another little walk around the block. we only walked two loops around our block but we made it a tiny bit further today (0.79 miles -> 1.54 miles total). i guess you'd say he's grown some! 😳 3 comments sunday, august 21, 2016 sweet girl and a walk in the rain reagan slept well last night and woke up this morning calm but sweet this morning. we did see one little episode of head turn to the left and eyes fixed upward to the left. it lasted maybe 30sec-1min or so and then she finally broke out of it. it's been about 20 days since we last saw that so it's still definitely looking like its following some sort of hormone fluctuations. this afternoon we took a nice little walk. we're thinking of signing reagan up for a halloween marathon in october, where kids can do their miles in the months leading up to the race and then the day of they do the last 1.2. ryan rode his bike and we followed behind. we did get stuck in the rain for a bit. reagan had a rain canopy, so she was the only one that stayed dry. ryan took off and rode super fast, even jumping the curb trying to get back to the house quickly. we only made it 0.75 mile, but it's a start. tonight reagan was beyond precious! so cuddly and sweet...we just couldn't get enough of her. ryan playing with a worm...poor worm! 0 comments saturday, august 20, 2016 sleepy, sensitive, but sweet reagan slept in this morning until around 11:30am. she woke up tense and a little whiny and eventually needed some lortab intervention. she dozed back off after the lortab and then slept until the afternoon. when she woke up, she was noticeably improved. she even had a little crack of a smile! we brought her downstairs where she was good (for the most part) for the rest of the night. she did have a few little hiccups where she got upset and either nearly or actually did start crying, but we were able to calm her down pretty quickly. i think she was just a little sensitive to our excitement over the olympics! ;) something is definitely a little off with her. she's been a little congested and had an interesting smell to her breath all day today. still grinding her teeth. she didn't poo yesterday, not even after her enema, so i think her tummy is definitely giving her some troubles. she's also had that ongoing issues holding her pees, although she was much better today and didn't need help going even once. 0 comments friday, august 19, 2016 calm, serious, but holding reagan slept well last night and woke up just in time for speech this morning. she did ok, considering she had just woken up, working on her eyegaze and even ate a little. she's been pretty serious today (with a little tooth grinding) but calm. and all day today she's been holding her pees. we had to use the water trick multiple times today just to get her to go at all. when she goes...she goes..but won't go on her own. today was also her day to poo (we use a mini enema every other day to help keep her regular) and it was the first time that she didn't go. not with the enema, not with help...not good. the crazy thing is, her body is still very relaxed, so it's not like the tone is what's interfering with everything. no idea what's going on with that little body of hers. she's been very calm and easy going though. tonight she wasn't falling asleep on her own and freaked out when we gave her clonidine. ugh. we just never know when it's going to work and when it's going to make her crazy. hoping she settles down soon and sleeps tonight!waiting for bubbles...where's ryan?she's soooo long! :) 0 comments thursday, august 18, 2016 tube change and pm&r follow up today was a super busy day for us all! ryan had speech therapy first thing this morning and then we came straight home to meet the teacher at his new school! after that we headed home and got ready for a even busier afternoon. we loaded up both kids in the car, dropped ryan off at aba, and drove to dell for reagan's gj-tube change. we have noticed the last several days her tube has been a little leaky and then yesterday we realized that the lock is also broken so the tube just freely spins around (making it more susceptible to popping out)...so at 4 months again it's definitely time for a change. they were able to squeeze her in at 2pm, giving us just enough to get that done and then head over to her pm&r appt. while we were waiting, i was texting with the dme rep about the carrot carseat and that we weren't sure if it needed more adjustments (this was the first time we had used it in the car), and the rep was able to just come meet us there since she was close by! so she was adjusting the carseat when they came to call us back. she continued making adjustments while we went in and had reagan's gj-tube changed. reagan was super calm and patient, which is good because the doctor again had an issue getting the tube out. the last time it was the balloon wouldn't deflate all the way, this time it was the tip of the tube that didn't want to come out! she was a rock star as always and just laid there being an angel. once it was finally replaced, we took a quick video so i could document the broken lock, and then we loaded up and headed over to her other appt. this was basically just a follow up appt to talk with the pm&r doctor about the fact that the myobloc (botox b) didn't work at all this time. it doesn't really leave us with any options. in my mind, surgery is not an option. it's too risky that she'll have a negative reaction to the anesthesia or surgery/pain and often times kids go through these surgeries and have no lasting benefit. the oral medications aren't really a good option for her either because you can't administer them as needed and i refuse to drug her up all of the time. at this point we really just have to stretch and use afos to try to get her upright and weight bearing and that's the best we can do. we're not going to reverse her super pointed feet, but hopefully we can find ways to work with them! my sweet ballerina! such a good, laid back girl today! 2 comments wednesday, august 17, 2016 laid back day reagan slept well last night and woke up sweet and snuggly this morning. only one therapy today, speech. she did well with that. we're talking to the tobii eyegaze people right now about getting a mount that we can use to make her eyegaze more accessible to her (so that she can use it where ever she might be sitting...tomato chair, wheelchair, etc...). the goal is obviously to give her the opportunity to communicate at all times, which means we need to find a way to give her access to the eyegaze as often as possible (not just during school or speech). a rep is coming out next week so hopefully we can come up with a solution that will work. reagan has been good all day today. very laid back and calm. she's got a busy day tomorrow (it'll be our first time to try the new car seat out), so i'm really hoping she gets a good night's sleep and wakes up just as laid back tomorrow! ;) today is my sister's birthday so i thought i'd post a picture of her and a little reagan! 💗 0 comments tuesday, august 16, 2016 carrot 3 car seat take 2! reagan slept well again last night and woke up super sweet this morning. she's still very loose in her body. super adorable. a little more vocal today, good vocal (a talky vocal not a crazy vocal). she had pt this morning followed by ot. she did well with both, but she did doze off at the end of ot with her gold medal in her hand! so adorable! of course we had to disturb her a little because the dme lady came by to fit the carrot carseat to her. i have to say, once all of the pieces were added, it looked like it might actually work! we put reagan in it and she never even cracked her eyes! she was out cold. she did eventually wake up and was awake until 10pm or so tonight. she's been very still and very calm all day today. she's kinda been holding her pees all day today, having several really large (flooding) pees. tonight her tummy was noticably distended, but i really think it was more gas than anything. i tried to move her around to help her get some of it out, but she ended up dozing off again in my arms. sweet girl.never moved a muscle! :) 2 comments monday, august 15, 2016 great cardiology appt reagan slept like a rock last night. this morning she was still asleep when we had to finally wake her up and get her dressed and ready to go to her cardiology appt. it was just her yearly check-up, but we figured there's no better day than a sleepy day to get an echo/ekg! i'm glad we woke her up and braved the rain because she was a perfect angel. any other day her movements might have made it tricky to get a good reading, but today she was so still and so calm and patient, she just laid perfectly still during the echo. the doctor looked over everything and said her heart still looks perfect! not a lot of systems functioning properly for my girl, but boy am i glad this one is in tip top shape! so we'll be back in another year for another routine check up. the rest of the day we just took it easy. another lazy rainy day. very loose, still hands, lots of yawns...so laid back. no therapies since we missed speech this morning. lots of snuggles. and hopefully another good night's sleep! 0 comments sunday, august 14, 2016 sweet dreams, sweet girl today was yet another super sleepy sunday for my girl. it seems like every other sunday (when grandma comes to visit) reagan has a sleepy day. it was the perfect day for sleep though, raining off and on all day. she slept in bed the entire day, not waking up until right around 7:30pm! thankfully she woke up and was a sweet darling girl! she wasn't awake for even a full 2hrs when grandma came in and started talking to her, lifted her legs up and she immediately dozed right back off. sweet dreams, sweet girl. really hoping she wakes up tomorrow feeling much more relaxed...she's just been so tense lately. 0 comments saturday, august 13, 2016 sensitive saturday and new genetic information reagan got a pretty good night's sleep last night. she fell asleep laying beside daddy. when i went to hook her up to her formula, she would open her eyes for a few seconds and then close them. she woke me up around 5:30am and i then moved her to her chair. i kept it dark in hopes she would go back to sleep, but i don't think that ever happened. her nurse got here at 7:30am and found her wide awake and laughy. she's had the crazy laughs off and on today. if you encourage it, she'll go on and on, to the point of almost tears (so we try not to encourage it). she's been pretty sensitive today to us talking and almost cried several times when we were just trying to have a conversation but forgot about her sensitivity! oops. excuse us, miss reagan! her body is still pretty tense and crunchy. i would love to see her mellow out and loosen up soon. she's been tense for quite sometime now. so yesterday, right around 6pm i got a call from reagan's pediatrician. apparently some geneticist from baylor had contacted him about reagan's whole exome sequencing. there was a mutation that had been found that had been linked to "intellectual disability" and upon reanalysis it was mentioned that it was possibly a "damaging" mutation but neither we nor our geneticist were sure what that meant. we weren't sure what other symptoms had been found in patients with this mutation and if it could have anything to do with reagan's health issues (which are way more concerning than her developmental delay). well, as it turns out, this geneticist has been collecting information on several patients (4) that have this exact same mutation as reagan c.892c>t (p.r298w) in the nacc1 gene and all of the kids had both infantile spasms/epilepsy and cataracts. now he wants to get more info on reagan so he can see if there are any additional similarities that reagan has with these other patients. so this may actually be the "cause" of all of reagan's issues. neither mike nor i have this mutation (and neither does ryan) so this is something called a de novo (new) mutation ("de novo mutations may explain genetic disorders in which an affected child has a mutation in every cell of the body but the parents do not and there's no family history of the disorder"). now does this mean that reagan doesn't have mitochondrial disease? yes and no. it means that she probably does not have primary mitochondrial disease, but we know from her muscle biospy testing that she does have mitochondrial dysfunction. so at this point i think she'd be considered to have secondary mitochondrial disease. these are all things we will discuss in sept when we have an appt with the geneticist in houston who is running the epi-743 study. of course we are going to consent to participation in this new study and hopefully we will find out more about the other kiddos that have this exact same super rare mutation. 3 comments friday, august 12, 2016 carrot car seat demo and box reagan finally slept well last night. she was quietly laying in bed when her nurse got here at 8am. she's been pretty sweet today. less vocal. still a lot of chorea but pretty calm overall. she only had one therapy today, pt, but she did well with that. today was a pretty laid back day. not a lot going on. we did have a new carseat demo dropped off. the carrot. we've been waiting for weeks to try it, but when they dropped it off we had a huge concern. see below. the carrot when compared to the recaro monza, looked as if it wouldn't even fit a toddler! after staring at it long enough, we realized that it was missing several pieces that make it a lot taller/bigger (although i'm still skeptical that it will be big enough). they called back to their warehouse and realized they had left an entire box of additional parts behind. someone eventually brought the box by late this afternoon, but they just dropped it off and left. so we'll probably have to get our dme rep to come by next week and help us get it all put together! it looks very cushy but i just can't see that it's going to be big enough for our growing, long legged girl. ryan was loving playing in the box that it came in. he was too funny! everyone was good tonight. we're of course watching a lot of olympics. tonight i have noticed some neurologic sensitivity/quirks in reagan, she's been showing some sensitivity in her eyes, a little gaggy/chokey off and on, and lots of stiffening of her arms. i'm not even going to try clonidine tonight, i'm just hoping laying down with daddy will do the trick. fingers crossed we all get some sleep again tonight! (i did have an interesting conversation today with reagan's pediatrician and then a geneticist in houston, but i will elaborate more on that tomorrow.) this is what we hated about the recaro monza! not enough support for reagan. it really needed a clip in the middle to help keep the straps on her shoulder (which were also cutting into her shoulders). as is, it was not safe. 1 comments thursday, august 11, 2016 similar days reagan made it in her bed a little longer last night. i think it was around 4am when i had to move her. i'm feeling a bit sleep deprived but she seems no worse for wear. reagan had pt this morning and ot this afternoon. she did well with both. during pt she did an art project and made the olympic rings (see below)! today has been pretty similar to yesterday. she's still super tense in her body, lots of movement and super crunchy, but she's been a good girl. a little serious, but good. she's been holding her pees off and on and i have noticed a slight smell to them, so all week i've been a little concerned maybe she was getting another uti. however we've tested multiple pees over multiple days and never found anything. i was just thinking that might be a reason for her being so tense and so vocal...but i guess not. hoping she finally gets a full night's sleep tonight! we could all use that!turtle position 0 comments wednesday, august 10, 2016 pretty good day but not so great sleep sleep wasn't great again last night. it was another night of her waking up around 2am and then having to be moved her to her chair. i think she probably went back to sleep, but who knows. she had speech this morning, not the best day for the eye gaze, she's just still so crunchy! she did seem to enjoy eating though. this afternoon she had a make up session of ot and then immediately had school. she did really well with both. overall she's been a good girl today. still very tense in her body but a little less kooky, which is good because all of the screaming was beginning to give me a headache! i did have a major malfunction tonight when making reagan's formula at 12am! ugh. what a mess. meanwhile mike was laying down with a clonidine crazy reagan. it's almost 1am now and she's just now quiet. hoping she finally gets a good night's sleep. here's her brother passed out cold at 5pm after a busy day. reagan take note of this.the mess! 😣 0 comments newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) 2016 umdf energy for life walkathon to join team rallying for reagan click here about me reagan leigh on august 21, 2007 (at exactly 5 months old), reagan had her first cluster of seizures. she was diagnosed at 6 months old with infantile spasms and 2 years later with mitochondrial disease. life has been a roller coaster for us and our baby girl but we've been blessed with wonderful friends and family to help us though this! view my complete profile my story email babyreaganleigh@yahoo.com **please leave a comment on the blog if you send me an email! otherwise i may never see it! :) ** blog archive ► 2018 (34) ► april (1) ► march (13) ► february (8) ► january (12) ► 2017 (348) ► december (31) ► november (26) ► october (27) ► september (29) ► august (30) ► july (24) ► june (30) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (28) ► january (31) ▼ 2016 (368) ► december (31) ► november (30) ► october (31) ► september (30) ▼ august (31) fever free, a little tense but cuddly sweet sick girl oh no...not a fever!?!?

__label__low porta de sião sexta-feira, 25 de maio de 2012 lição 9 - as sete taças da ira de deus igreja evangélica assembléia de deus av. brasil, 740 – juiz de fora - mg elaboração da aula para os professores da escola dominical revista: apocalipse prof. magda narciso leite – classe sara texto áureo: “e vi outro grande e admirável sinal no céu: sete anjos que tinham as sete últimas pragas, porque nelas é consumada a ira de deus” (ap 15.1). verdade aplicada: só entenderemos as maravilhosas implicações de pertencer à igreja, quando formos arrebatados para estar para sempre com o senhor. objetivos da lição: · exaltar a importância da igreja e o privilégio incomparável de pertencer a ela. · enfatizar que estaremos prontos para julgar o mundo quando amarmos justiça e a santidade. · deixar claro que só serão julgados por deus aqueles que se recusarem a sofrer a disciplina do senhor. textos de referência: ap 15.5,6; 16.1,7,17 introdução: você estudou na lição anterior que a pregação do evangelho eterno será, ao mesmo tempo, apelo à conversão, anúncio da destruição da sociedade fundada na injustiça e na soberba humana e aviso quanto ao destino último da besta e de seus adoradores. cumpridas estas etapas o julgamento divino sobre a terra e seus habitantes será concluído e as últimas sentenças serão executadas “porque nelas é consumada a ira de deus”. a lição anterior trouxe o relato quanto a visão que joão teve dos cento e quarenta e quatro mil selados juntos ao cordeiro no monte sião. o monte sião no texto de ap 14.1 além de trazer um vislumbre quanto à sede do futuro reino milenar de jesus cristo, sendo esta em jerusalém, é também uma figura de linguagem para o céu (ver hb 12.22,23), o que indica a presença dos cento e quarenta e quatro mil selados junto ao cordeiro no céu depois destes cumprirem o seu ministério na terra (ver ap 14.2-5). o texto de ap 14-15 prossegue apresentando ainda os seguintes acontecimentos antes de se ter início o derramamento das sete taças da ira de deus: · em ap 14.6-13 joão relata a visão de três anjos que proclamam o evangelho eterno e os juízos de deus a todos os habitantes da terra, e a toda nação, e tribo e língua e povo. · em ap 14.14-20 a visão de joão diz respeito a ceifa e a vindima, quando então no período dos três anos e meio finais da grande tribulação, gentios e judeus estarão sendo preparados para a batalha do armagedom. joão tem uma antevisão da batalha, porém o ajuntamento de judeus e gentios para esta batalha somente acontece depois do derramamento da sexta taça descrita em ap 16.12-16, sendo o seu cumprimento final descrito em ap 19.11-21. · em ap 15.2-4 a visão de joão diz respeito aos salvos do período final da grande tribulação antes de se ter início o derramamento das sete taças da ira de deus. muitos são vistos no céu tendo saídos vitoriosos da besta, e da sua imagem, e do seu sinal, e do número do seu nome, tendo provavelmente sofrido o martírio por amor ao senhor jesus e a sua palavra (ver ap 13.10; 14.12,13). · em ap 15.5-8 a visão de joão diz respeito aos últimos preparativos no céu para que tenha então início o derramamento das sete taças da ira de deus sobre a terra. esta lição fala da ceifa e da vindima, da antevisão que joão tem da batalha do armagedom; do anúncio feito pelos três anjos antes da visão da ceifa e da vindima; dos últimos preparativos no céu para dar início ao derramamento das taças e do derramamento de quatro taças dos juízos de deus. 1. curiosidades iniciais – a seção intitulada “a ceifa e a vindima” (ap 14.14-20) faz parte dos preparativos para o derramamento das últimas pragas da ira de deus, por isso, foi incluída nesta lição. nela aparecem quatro anjos que somados aos três de apocalipse 14.6-13 perfazem um total de sete. pelas suas características parecem apontar para os anjos das trombetas em apocalipse 8.2, e para os que derramarão os sete cálices do furor de deus sobre a terra. em ap 8.2, joão relata a visão de sete anjos que estavam diante de deus aos quais foram entregues as sete trombetas do juízos de deus: “e vi os sete anjos que estavam diante de deus, e foram-lhes dadas sete trombetas”. na seção intitulada “a ceifa e a vindima”, posterior ao anúncio do evangelho eterno e dos juízos de deus feito por três anjos em ap 14.6-11, joão vê assentado sobre uma nuvem branca “um semelhante ao filho do homem” e depois três outros anjos. as características destes sete em ap 14.6-20, pelo menos em parte, não parecem apontar para os anjos das trombetas em ap 8.2 e nem para os sete anjos que tem as sete pragas em ap 15.1 “e vi outro grande e admirável sinal no céu: sete anjos que tinham as sete últimas pragas, porque nelas é consumada a ira de deus”, pois notadamente aquele assentado sobre uma nuvem branca semelhante ao filho do homem é o próprio senhor jesus cristo. o que estas passagens têm em comum é o número sete que traz em si o ensino quanto a perfeição de deus em seus propósitos e na aplicação de seus juízos. 1.1 o anjo de coroa na cabeça e foice na mão – apocalipse 14.14 e daniel 7.13 indicam que esse [...] é o senhor: esse alguém como “filho do homem” é uma figura de cristo, que está pronto para lançar a foice do julgamento, em um mundo já amadurecido pela maldade e perversidade. é bom observar que o anjo não dá ordem ao que está assentado, ele clama, como alguém que sabe o momento de agir. [...]. 1.2 a colheita final – [...] serão condenados os [...] habitantes da terra, os adoradores da besta [...]. os cachos de uvas serão colhidos e lançados no lagar da ira de deus (ap 14.19), “mas o trigo, ajuntai-o no meu celeiro” (mt 13.30). o texto de ap 14.14-20 pode ser dividido em duas partes. o trecho referente aos versículos 14 a 16 trata da ceifa estando esta relacionada, segundo escreve a. gilberto (2000, p. 158) às nações gentílicas e o trecho referente aos versículos 17 a 20, segundo o mesmo autor, trata da vindima estando esta relacionada à nação de israel. joão começa trazendo o relato quanto a visão de “uma nuvem branca e, assentado sobre a nuvem, um semelhante ao filho do homem, que tinha sobre a cabeça uma coroa de ouro e, na mão, uma foice aguda”. sendo o termo “filho do homem” uma linguagem referente ao senhor jesus (ver dn 7.13) e o branco símbolo de justiça, a expressão utilizada por joão identifica aquele que estava assentado sobre a nuvem como sendo o próprio senhor jesus em sua majestade como rei, estando ele pronto a exercer justiça, e daí ele ter em sua mão “uma foice aguda”. a sega que é então descrita no versículo 16 e que é realizada pelo próprio senhor jesus “e aquele que estava assentado sobre a nuvem meteu a sua foice à terra, e a terra foi segada” trata-se do julgamento do senhor sobre as nações gentílicas amadurecidas então pela maldade, perversidade, iniqüidade etc..., sendo isto notadamente reconhecido pelo anjo que sai do templo e que clama com grande voz: “lança a tua foice e sega! é já vinda a hora de segar, porque já a seara da terra está madura”. através da foice em suas mãos, jesus faz separação entre os bons e os maus, e desta forma, as nações gentílicas sofrerão os juízos das taças que ocasionará a morte de muitos (vidas ceifadas), e além disto estas nações serão também conduzidas a se agruparem para a batalha do armagedom que terá então ocasião no final dos últimos três anos e meio da grande tribulação. acerca de ap 14.14-16, w. malgo (2000, v. 3, p. 83) escreve: “‘...e aquele que estava sentado sobre a nuvem passou sua foice sobre a terra, e a terra foi ceifada’. uma ceifa estranha, que não podemos compreender racionalmente! essa ceifa de juízo engloba todas as catástrofes, que acontecerão em breve sobre esta terra. as taças da cólera de deus serão derramadas; para horror de todo o mundo, babilônia desmorona com grande barulho; são cortados os mais importantes nervos vitais, seus adornos reais, sendo coberta de pragas, miséria e fogo. se joão diz aqui: ‘...e a terra foi ceifada’, então ele fala da conclusão definitiva desta era da graça, como fez também o senhor quando estava sobre a terra: ‘a ceifa é a consumação do século’ (mt 13.39). esse é o curto, mas gravíssimo, conteúdo da visão de joão sobre armagedom, sobre a luta final dos povos, que é descrita detalhadamente em apocalipse [...] 16”. em ap 14.17, joão vê saindo do templo, “que está no céu, outro anjo, o qual também tinha uma foice aguda”. na seqüência, ele vê sair do “altar outro anjo, que tinha poder sobre o fogo, e clamou com grande voz ao que tinha a foice aguda, dizendo: lança a tua foice aguda e vindima os cachos da vinha da terra, porque já as suas uvas estão maduras” (ap 14.18). a vinha da terra é uma figura de linguagem referente a nação de israel (ver sl 80.8-15; jr 2.21; os 10.1,2; jl 1.7), e suas uvas maduras uma figura de linguagem para o israel apóstata. a vindima que é descrita em ap 14.19 “e o anjo meteu a sua foice à terra, e vindimou as uvas da vinha da terra, e lançou-as no grande lagar da ira de deus” trata-se, portanto do juízo de deus sobre o israel apóstata da época da grande tribulação, sendo este constituído por aqueles que se recusarem a reconhecer o senhor jesus como o verdadeiro messias de israel. a nação de israel estará neste período, também sendo conduzida a se agrupar para a batalha do armagedom, sendo que esta acontecerá no vale do megido (ver zc 12.11), o qual é chamado em ap 14.19 de o grande lagar da ira de deus. o julgamento das nações gentílicas representado pela ceifa e da nação de israel representado pela vindima, no grande lagar da ira de deus é também mencionado pelo profeta joel em jl 3.11-13: “ajuntai-vos, e vinde, todos os povos em redor, e congregai-vos (ó senhor, faze descer ali os teus fortes!); movam-se as nações e subam ao vale de josafá; porque ali me assentarei, para julgar todas as nações em redor. lançai a foice, porque já está madura a seara; vinde, descei, porque o lagar está cheio, os vasos dos lagares transbordam; porquanto a sua malícia é grande”. em ap 14.20, joão tem uma antevisão desta batalha quando então ele escreve: “e o lagar foi pisado fora da cidade, e saiu sangue do lagar até aos freios dos cavalos, pelo espaço de mil e seiscentos estádios”. tal linguagem indica o grande número de mortes que acontecerá por ocasião desta batalha tanto no que diz respeito aos gentios agrupados contra israel quanto no que diz respeito aos judeus que mantiverem os seus corações endurecidos. acerca desta passagem, w. macdonald (2008, p. 1011), escreve: “as uvas maduras são colhidas e lançadas no grande lagar da cólera de deus. o processo de pisar as uvas para fazer vinho é usado aqui para retratar um julgamento esmagador. a vindima se dará fora da cidade de jerusalém, talvez no vale de josafá. a carnificina será tão grande que o sangue correrá como um riacho a uma profundidade correspondente ao nível dos freios dos cavalos e por uma extensão de quase trezentos quilômetros, a distância entre jerusalém e o sul de edom”. 1.3 os três anjos e a proclamação dos juízos (ap 14.6-13) – observamos mais uma vez outro vislumbre da graça divina, um último alerta, um último escape. deus nunca se deixou a si mesmo sem testemunho. antes de sua manifestação como o messias de israel, enviou joão batista (mt 3.1). observando o apocalipse vemos que deus tem pausado juízos para aplicar sua benigna misericórdia. agora, os anjos saem antes que as sete últimas taças sejam lançadas na terra. o objetivo da mensagem é que toda tribo, língua e nação tema ao senhor e lhe dê glória, porque vinda é a hora do juízo (ap 14.6,7). na seqüência, o segundo anjo traz a revelação antecipada da queda de babilônia (a igreja falsa mundial), e o terceiro avisa que os que forem selados pela besta estarão perdidos para sempre (ap 14.8-11). a conclusão da mensagem é paciência, morte e bem aventurança (ap 14.12,12). neste tempo não haverá a frase “sou evangélico”, como muitos apenas a declaram sem ter nada haver com cristo. neste tempo, ser cristão não será status, será renunciar a própria vida. joão relata em ap 14.6-11, antes do relato acerca da ceifa e da vindima, a visão de três anjos que proclamam o evangelho eterno e os juízos de deus sobre a terra. tal fato indica que deus ainda dará aos homens mais uma oportunidade para que estes recebam a salvação eterna antes que tenha início o derramamento das sete taças, nas quais é consumada a ira de deus sobre a terra. o primeiro anjo é visto a voar pelo meio do céu, tendo “o evangelho eterno, para o proclamar aos que habitam sobre a terra, e a toda nação, e tribo, e língua e povo” (ap 14.6b). este anjo conclama todos a temerem a deus e dar-lhe glória, advertindo quanto a vinda da hora do seu juízo. o anjo exalta a deus como o criador do céu, e da terra, e do mar, e das fontes de águas e desta forma, ele convoca os homens a adorá-lo em contraposição aos acontecimentos na terra onde muitos, encantados com o anticristo, estarão a este falso messias prestando adoração (ver ap 13.4). o segundo anjo segue trazendo uma antevisão quanto a queda do falso sistema de religião representado por babilônia: “caiu! caiu babilônia, aquela grande cidade que a todas as nações deu a beber do vinho da ira da sua prostituição!” (ap 14.8). a queda, porém de fato de babilônia é relatada somente em ap 17, e sendo assim a queda sendo vista como já consumada no anúncio feito pelo anjo indica a oportunidade que ainda será dada aos homens para que estes fujam de todo falso sistema de religião, pois estes serão também alvos dos juízos de deus. o terceiro anjo adverte os homens a não adorarem a besta, ou seja, o anticristo e sua imagem e também a não receberem o sinal da besta na testa ou na mão, pois o destino daqueles que assim procederem será a participação nos juízos de deus representados pelas taças. o anjo fala também do destino final daqueles que adorarem a besta, sendo este a perdição eterna, conforme fica subentendido em ap 14.9-11: “se alguém adorar a besta e a sua imagem e receber o sinal na testa ou na mão, também o tal beberá do vinho da sua ira, e será atormentado com fogo e enxofre diante dos santos anjos e diante do cordeiro. e a fumaça do seu tormento sobe para todo o sempre; e não tem repouso, nem de dia nem de noite, os que adoram a besta e a sua imagem e aquele que receber o sinal do seu nome” (ap 14.9-11). em ap 14.12, joão mostra a importância dos santos, aqueles que ainda estiverem vivos e outros que se converterem durante este período final de grande tribulação, perseverarem na fé resistindo ao anticristo e na obediência aos mandamentos de deus em meio às perseguições e aos sofrimentos deste período. na seqüência, joão descreve uma voz que vinda do céu, ordena que ele escreva: “bem aventurados os mortos, que desde agora, morrem no senhor. sim, diz o espírito, para que descansem dos seus trabalhos, e as suas obras os sigam” (ap 14.13). este versículo indica que muitos salvos, tanto judeus como gentios, morrerão ainda antes do derramamento das sete taças da ira de deus, sendo estes provavelmente aqueles que são vistos posteriormente por joão no céu, conforme se descreve em ap 15.2-4: “e vi um como mar de vidro misturado com fogo e também os que saíram vitoriosos da besta, e da sua imagem, e do seu sinal, e do número do seu nome, que estavam junto ao mar de vidro e tinham as harpas de deus. e cantavam o cântico de moisés, servo de deus, e o cântico do cordeiro, dizendo: grandes e maravilhosas são as tuas obras, senhor, deus todo-poderoso! justos e verdadeiros são os teus caminhos, ó rei dos santos! quem te não temerá, ó senhor, e não magnificará o teu nome? porque só tu és santo; por isso, todas as nações virão e se prostrarão diante de ti, porque os teu juízos são manifestos”. 2. os anjos das sete taças da ira de deus – o capítulo 15 relata a detalhada preparação para o julgamento final. “e os sete anjos... saíram do templo” (ap 15.6). o juízo provém do mesmo templo celestial. os anjos saem não como servos ou mensageiros, mas como administradores reais do juízo, cingidos à altura do peito com cintos de ouro. a ira de deus é repartida entre os sete anjos por um dos seres viventes e estará contida em sete taças de ouro. ap 15.5-8: “e depois disto olhei, e eis que o templo do tabernáculo do testemunho se abriu no céu. e os sete anjos que tinham as sete pragas saíram do templo, vestidos de linho puro e resplandecente, e cingidos com cintos de ouro pelos peitos. e um dos quatro animais deu aos sete anjos sete taças de ouro, cheias da ira de deus, que vive para todo o sempre. e o templo encheu-se com a fumaça da glória de deus e do seu poder; e ninguém podia entrar no templo, até que se consumassem as sete pragas dos sete anjos”. 2.1 eles saíram do templo no céu (ap 15.5,6) – no presente texto, “o templo” que joão viu se abrir” não foi na terra, mas no céu. o apóstolo contemplou o interior do “lugar” do testemunho de deus. os judeus criam que as coisas terrenas eram figuras das coisas celestiais (hb 8.5; 9.23), de maneira que o templo terrestre era apenas uma cópia do celestial (ap 3.12; 7.15; 11.19; 14.15). a grande lição que aprendemos aqui é que do templo procede a justiça e, sendo a igreja uma cópia do templo celeste, devemos estar prontos para combater a toda sorte de injustiças através de nossos agentes. em ap 15.5, joão olha e vê se abrir no céu, o templo do tabernáculo do testemunho. esta linguagem traz em memória o santo dos santos, onde no tabernáculo encontrava-se a arca de deus e em seu interior as tábuas da lei, as tábuas do testemunho no qual governo justo e moral de deus é revelado. a abertura do templo do tabernáculo do testemunho neste momento indica o justo juízo de deus sobre o mundo ímpio que amou mais as trevas do que a luz, e diante disto os sete anjos que tinham as sete pragas saem do templo de forma que nada mais poderá tardar o derramamento das sete taças da ira de deus sobre a terra. sl 11.4-7: “o senhor está no seu santo templo, o trono do senhor está nos céus; os seus olhos estão atentos, e as suas pálpebras provam os filhos dos homens. o senhor prova o justo; porém ao ímpio e ao que ama a violência odeia a sua alma. sobre os ímpios fará chover laços, fogo, enxofre e vento tempestuoso; isto será a porção do seu copo. porque o senhor é justo, e ama a justiça; o seu rosto olha para os retos”. 2.2 eles estão vestidos de linho puro – observamos que os trajes dos anjos, no presente texto são semelhantes aos trajes de cristo descritos no capítulo 1.13. eles simbolizam a dignidade e o “elevado ofício”. o linho puro aponta para a justiça dos santos, roupagem que a noiva de cristo vestirá (ap 19.8). [...]. 2.3 peito cingido com cinto de ouro – em isaías 15.11 está escrito: “e a justiça será o cinto dos seus lombos”. estas vestes e cintos só eram usados pelos sacerdotes e juízes da alta corte. no caso dos anjos nesta seção, refere-se a função de “juízes” por eles desempenhada. os sete magistrados da suprema corte estavam cingidos com cinto de ouro e a mesma coisa é dita acerca de cristo (ap 1.13). eles eram uma comissão proveniente dos mais elevados céus. seus trajes simbolizam poder, dignidade, retidão e verdade (is 22.21; ef 6.14). os trajes dos anjos semelhantes aos trajes de cristo indicam o senhorio de cristo sobre os anjos que em tudo lhe obedecem, inclusive na execução dos juízos de deus. além disto, o linho branco indica a pureza e justiça de suas ações, já que o linho puro na bíblia é símbolo de justiça. o fato dos anjos estarem cingidos com cintos de ouro pelo peito e não pela cintura indica que nenhuma intercessão poderá deter a ira de deus sobre a impiedade dos homens. o cinto de ouro pelo peito fala do juízo de deus, enquanto que o cinto de ouro na cintura fala da graça de deus em função do ofício sacerdotal de jesus cristo no santo dos santos. em ap 15.7, joão observa que é um dos quatro animais que dá aos sete anjos as sete taças cheias da ira de deus. sendo os quatro animais, querubins representando a criação de deus, esta entrega mostra os juízos de deus também em resposta ao clamor de sua própria criação, pois conforme paulo diz em rm 8.20-22: “...a criação ficou sujeita à vaidade, não por sua própria vontade, mas por causa do que a sujeitou, na esperança de que também a mesma criatura será libertada da servidão da corrupção, para a liberdade da glória dos filhos de deus. porque sabemos que toda a criação geme e está juntamente com dores de parto até agora”. o templo se enche “com a fumaça da gloria de deus e do seu poder; e ninguém podia entrar no templo, até que se consumassem as sete pragas dos sete anjos” (ap 15.8). esta linguagem de ap 15.8 indica, mais uma vez a impossibilidade de qualquer intercessão sacerdotal, conforme também compreende w. macdonald (2008, p. 1011) de acordo com o seguinte comentário descrito abaixo: “o ato de ninguém poder penetrar no santuário, enquanto não se cumprirem os sete flagelos significa que, agora, nenhuma intercessão sacerdotal poderá deter a ira de deus”. 3. os alvos das quatro primeiras taças – no capítulo 16, à semelhança das pragas derramadas sobre o egito, os sete anjos recebem ordem para despejar suas taças sobre a terra. será o julgamento definitivo anunciado pela proclamação do evangelho eterno. será também a última etapa do resgate do povo de deus dos domínios do iníquo e da purificação do planeta. um processo parecido com a colheita e o preparo do solo para um novo plantio. depois virá o milênio. ap 16.1: “e ouvi, vinda do templo, uma grande voz, que dizia aos sete anjos: ide, e derramai sobre a terra as sete taças da ira de deus”. em ap 15.7, joão viu quando um dos quatro animais deu aos sete anjos as sete taças de ouro cheias da ira de deus. os sete anjos, porém apesar de já estarem em todos os sentidos prontos para a execução, não podem tomar nenhuma atitude, enquanto não é emitida a ordem vinda do templo. este fato é importante, pois revela a total supremacia e soberania de deus sobre toda sua criação e desta forma nenhum acontecimento sobre a terra e todo universo pode ocorrer senão sob a permissão do deus todo-poderoso. 3.1 o solo – o primeiro anjo despejará sua taça sobre a terra e atingirá todas as pessoas que trouxerem em seus corpos a marca da besta. os adoradores da besta adoecerão de umas chagas malignas e dolorosas semelhantes a úlceras (ap 16.2; zc 14.12,13). será o complemento da primeira trombeta (ap 8.7), quando somente a vegetação foi atingida. os servos de deus nada sofrerão desta e das outras pragas, porque os que não tiverem morrido pelas mãos da besta (ap 13.7), gozarão de proteção especial do selo de deus. ap 16.2: “e foi o primeiro, e derramou a sua taça sobre a terra, e fez-se uma chaga má e maligna nos homens que tinham o sinal da besta e que adoravam a sua imagem”. conforme foi visto no ponto 1.3, muitos salvos morrerão antes do derramamento das sete taças sendo estes assim poupados dos juízos vindouros das sete taças através da morte (ver ap 14.13). pode ser, porém que nem todos venham a morrer e desta forma, haverão ainda salvos vivos durante o período do derramamento das taças. a chaga má e maligna proveniente do derramamento da primeira taça, porém não os atinge, pois o texto de ap 16.2 mostra esta atingindo somente aqueles que terão o sinal da besta e que estarão prestando adoração a sua imagem. 3.2 as águas – o segundo e o terceiro anjo derramarão as suas taças sobre as águas. o primeiro, no mar, ou seja, em todas as águas que separam os continentes. morrerão todos os seres que habitam nas águas, que se tornará em sangue (ap 16.3. a navegação se tornará impraticável. o segundo derramará sobre as águas potáveis que, feitas sangue serão dadas a beber aos assassinos dos santos e profetas (ap 16.6). estas duas pragas completam os julgamentos iniciados pelos toques da segunda e da terceira trombeta (ap 8.8-11). ap 16.3-7: “e o segundo anjo derramou a sua taça no mar, que se tornou em sangue como de um morto, e morreu no mar toda a alma vivente. e o terceiro anjo derramou a sua taça nos rios e nas fontes das águas, e se tornaram em sangue. e ouvi o anjo das águas, que dizia: justo és tu, ó senhor, que és, e que eras, e santo és, porque julgaste estas coisas. visto como derramaram o sangue dos santos e dos profetas, também tu lhes deste o sangue a beber; porque disto são merecedores. e ouvi outro do altar, que dizia: na verdade, ó senhor deus todo-poderoso, verdadeiros e justos são os teus juízos”. a segunda trombeta levou a terça parte do mar tornar-se em sangue, ocorrendo a morte da terça parte das criaturas no mar e perda da terça parte das naus. no derramamento da segunda taça o mar como um todo é atingido transformando a água em sangue e isto afeta toda alma vivente no mar. o toque da terceira trombeta afetou terça parte dos rios e fontes de águas tornando as águas amargas. no derramamento da terceira taça toda água nos rios e fontes se tornam em sangue. o derramamento da segunda e terceira taças deve provocar um desequilíbrio sobre a economia mundial por afetar a navegação, além de desencadear mau cheiro, sede, fome, seca, doenças e tantos outros flagelos em decorrência dos efeitos de morte no mar e em decorrência da falta de água potável. os juízos de deus são reconhecidos como justos pelo “anjo das águas”, que vê neles a justa retribuição de deus àqueles que foram responsáveis pela morte dos santos e dos profetas. a voz ouvida por joão “do altar”, onde os juízos de deus são considerados justos, mostra que o clamor dos mártires debaixo do altar de deus, desde a morte de abel, é agora respondido por deus, depois de um longo tempo onde a graça de deus prevaleceu dando oportunidade aos homens para se arrependerem. 3.3 o sol – o quarto anjo despejará sua taça sobre o sol que emitirá muito mais calor do que o habitual (ap 16.8). essa praga é o fechamento dos juízos começados em ap 8.12 e exibirá de uma vez por todas o caráter dos ímpios. debaixo do excessivo calor solar blasfemarão de deus (ap 16.9). é o recrudescimento da criatura contra o criador, que já foi mostrado em apocalipse 9.20. assim, vemos que quando o homem rejeita a graciosa salvação em jesus, traça, ele mesmo o seu próprio destino: a primeira morte e a segunda (ap 19.21), que é o lago de fogo (ap 20.15). ap 16.8,9: “e o quarto anjo derramou a sua taça sobre o sol, e foi-lhe permitido que abrasasse os homens com fogo. e os homens foram abrasados com grandes calores, e blasfemaram o nome de deus, que tem poder sobre estas pragas; e não se arrependeram para lhe darem glória”. a quarta trombeta afetou terça parte do sol e da lua e das estrelas. no derramamento da quarta taça o sol parece ser afetado causando alterações no universo, de forma que os efeitos solares atingirão os homens em grande proporção. o sofrimento atingirá os homens, porém ao contrário do que muitos dizem, aqueles que não vieram a deus pelo amor, não virão também pela dor, antes pelo contrário, de forma arrogante blasfemarão o nome de deus. referências bibliográficas: a. gilberto, daniel e apocalipse – compreendendo o plano de deus para estes últimos dias, 2000, 16ª ed., cpad, rio de janeiro, rj. w. macdonald, comentário bíblico popular, 2008, mundo cristão, são paulo, sp. w. malgo, apocalipse de jesus cristo – um comentário para a nossa época, 2000, obra missionária chamada da meia noite, porto alegre, rs. postado por magda às 16:08 reações: enviar por e-mailblogthis!compartilhar no twittercompartilhar no facebookcompartilhar com o pinterest 3 comentários: suelen disse... sou professora da ebd, e confesso, que este material me ajudou muito mesmo, tendo em vista o quão complexo é o assunto!!deus abençoe muito!!obrigada!! 25 de maio de 2012 18:51 antónio jesus batalha disse... suas mensagens são muito boas e vir a seu blog é uma benção.dou-lhe os parabéns e continue nessa sua força trazendo a cada dia essas mensagens gratificantes de edificação, consolação e exortação. é este o alvo da nossa vida, incentivar a continuar a nossa caminhada pelas veredas da luz, com alegria falando das maravilhas do nosso salvador. que sua vida brilhe mais e mais a cada dia. se desejar fazer parte de meus amigos virtuais é só clikar. faça-o de forma a que possa seguir também seu blog. as minhas cordiais saúdações em cristo jesus. 26 de maio de 2012 13:49 anônimo disse... ola amada por gentileza estamos com duvida estamos te aconpanhando em todas as liçoes nao consegui enteder o pq da contagem de 7 anjos no capitulo 14 por favor nos ajude aguardo rertorno agnaldoss@bol.com.as características destes sete em ap 14.6-20, pelo menos em parte, não parecem apontar para os anjos das trombetas em ap 8.2 br 17 de junho de 2012 17:31 postar um comentário postagem mais recente postagem mais antiga página inicial assinar: postar comentários (atom) páginas início escola bíblica dominical artigos publicados vídeos outros autores centenário das assembléias de deus no brasil escola bíblica dominical para crianças escola teológica pr sebastião vieira de souza pensamentos "qualquer ensinamento que não se enquadre nas escrituras deve ser rejeitado, mesmo que faça chover milagres todos os dias". martinho lutero -------------------------------------- "o louvor deve ser centrado em cristo, e não no homem;

דיסקוס באליפות אירופה לנוער לאחר ששיפרה את שיאה האישי בגמר. אדם יעקובי עלה לחצי הגמר ב-400 מ' משוכות עם שיא אישי חדש אסטל ולאנו ממכבי ת"א עשתה הישג מדהים כשסיימה במקום השביעי בגמר תחרות זריקת דיסקוס בו קבעה 49.74 מ' ושיפרה את שיאה האישי ב-6 ס"מ. ולאנו סיכמה את התחרות, ולמעשה את העונה כולה: "בשנתיים האחרונות לא הצלחתי להתעלות על עצמי בתחרויות בין-לאומיות חו"ל. לא הצלחתי להביא לידי ביטוי את יכולתי האמיתית. והנה השנה כן הצלחתי לעשות זאת. החל מהתחרות הבין-ארצית לנוער באוקראינה, בה זכיתי בזהב עם 48.62 מ', וסגור עכשיו, באליפות אירופה לנוער, אותה סיימתי בשיא אישי חדש. בגמר, לאחר שני סיבובים דורגתי שמינית עם 47 מטר. בזריקה השלישית הצלחתי להתרכז היטב, התאפסתי וזרקתי 49.74 מ' – תוצאה המהווה שיפור של 6 ס"מ לשיאי, אבל מעבר לכך, הקפיצה אותי שלב אחד, למקום השביעי בדירוג הכללי בתחרות. אני גאה בעובדה שהתעליתי בזמן ובמקום הנכונים. אם יש משהו חשוב שלמדתי מהתחרות הזאת, זה שחייבים תמיד לשאוף גבוה, ושהדירוג לפני התחרות לא בהכרח קובע, ושהכול תלוי בצורה בה כל מתחרה נכנסת באופן אינדיווידואלי באותו יום של התחרות. בהזדמנות זו אני רוצה להודות למאמן שלי פליקס גרומדסקי שבלעדיו זה לא היה קורה, וכמובן למשפחה, לחברים שתמכו בי תמיד, וכמובן לאגודה שלי מכבי תל-אביב ולאיגוד האתלטיקה שעמדו מאחוריי בכל דבר שעשיתי". הצלחה נוספת רם גם רץ המשוכות אדם יעקובי מהפועל חולון שקבע בסיבוב הראשון 52.81 ש', שיפר את שיאו האישי ב-34 מאיות ועלה לחצי הגמר כאחד המפסידים המהירים ביותר. גם במקרה של יעקובי מדובר בהצלחה משותפת שלו

euskadi, galicia y asturias respectivamente, lo que se traduce en "la continuidad de sus marcas y equipos profesionales". la suma de los tres mercados en los que opera el grupo —euskadi, galicia y asturias—, representa el 12,76% de la población y el 13,34% del pib del conjunto del estado. la empresa destaca, además, que las marcas tienen "vinculación emocional" con sus clientes, al tratarse de compañías arraigadas en sus territorios de creación. la operación ha sido aprobada por unanimidad por e l consejo de administración de euskaltel y quedará culminada tras la ratificación en la próxima junta general de accionistas del grupo y la aprobación por parte de las autoridades de la competencia. el acuerdo incluye la incorporación de zegona como accionista del grupo euskaltel con el 15% del capital. así, la comunicación aclara que la operación tendrá una contraprestación que consiste en 186,5 millones que se abonarán en efectivo y 26,8 millones de acciones ordinarias de eukaltel de nueva emisión que suscribirá zegona a un precio de 9,5% por acción y que representarán el 15% del capital social de la primera tras la ampliación. la contraprestación en efectivo estará sujeta a los ajustes de deuda neta y capital circulante habituales en esta clase de operaciones, y los títulos de nueva emisión de euskaltel no conllevarán el derecho a recibir ningún dividendo acordado y pendiente de pago correspondiente a los resultados del ejercicio 2016. contraprestación futura al mismo tiempo, zegona tendrá derecho a una contraprestación contingente, con un límite de 15 millones, equivalente al 35% del valor patrimonial de determinados activos que puedan aflorar en ciertas condiciones, correspondiendo a euskaltel el 65% de dicho valor. es decir: que según la evolución de telecable, podría realizarse el pago de estos 15 millones adicionales, que son los que pueden elevar el precio final de la operación a 701 millones de euros. como parte de la operación, zegona podrá transmitir sus acciones en euskaltel directamente a sus propios socios, aunque con ciertas limitaciones: para cada tercio de su participación deberá esperar 12, 18 y 24 meses, respectivamente. en un comunicado, euskaltel ha subrayado que, con esta compra, que ha calificado de "hito", protagoniza "la gran consolidación del cable en el norte" de españa. año y medio después del acuerdo de integración de euskaltel y r, telecable se incorpora al grupo, que a partir de ahora ofrecerá sus servicios a un mercado de seis millones de personas, lo que supone un aumento del 20%. prestará 2,4 millones de servicios diarios a más de 800.000 clientes. aseguran que mantendrán su remuneración al accionista tal y como estaba previsto. según el calendario de la documentación entregada a la cnmv, ya se han realizado los análisis contables y se ha iniciado el proceso de compra. en junio está prevista la aprobación en la junta de accionistas y para el tercer trimestre del año esperan tener cerrada la operación, tras los permisos de la competencia y el regulador bursátil. laurea triennale hurley krush live drifit racer tank, color azul,gris, talla l scarpe alte antiforo mod paride s3 nº 40 superga

elementi in equilibrio armonioso che concorrono alla costruzione del tuo futuro. a noi di solunet piace pensare in grande, e proprio in questa prospettiva immaginiamo un prossimo futuro in cui la maggior parte dei server fisici non esisterà più e sarà sostituita dalla virtualizzazione. in quest’ottica, ti offriamo anche il tda salón mujer negro : perché sognare è bello, ma con noi può diventare realtà. una realtà che comprende anche pulabo corsé de encaje para mujer deshuesados de acero en espiral underbust cintura cincher negro : la nostra carta vincente è, infatti, intercettare il problema prima che arrivi al cliente. la virtualizzazione ha picard really s shoulderbag cafe : sappiamo che si tratta di un investimento iniziale, ma la scalabilità e il guadagno visibile già nel breve periodo ne faranno un vantaggio a lungo termine. il servizio di server dedicato è indicato per applicazioni in cui il cliente ha bisogno della più totale autonomia nella installazione, gestione e configurazione di applicazioni, unitamente ad una elevata disponibilità di memoria, disco, e potenza di processore. in tal caso pansevice metterà a disposizione un server interamente dedicato al cliente, con installato il sistema operativo linux (centos 5.4 o altro sistema nel caso di esigenze particolari) oppure windows 2003 o 2008 web edition, che potrà essere utilizzato in completa libertà, installando qualsiasi tipologia di software necessaria alle proprie esigenze. l'accesso al server potrà avvenire unicamente via internet, tramite appositi strumenti di amministrazione remota1. il servizio di server virtuale è invece indicato per applicazioni che, pur avendo bisogno di autonomia nella gestione dei servizi, non ha bisogno però di elevate prestazioni, memoria, o spazio disco. in questo caso panservice mette a disposizione del cliente non un intero server fisico, ma una porzione di uno dei propri server, tramite un software di virtualizzazione che permette comunque di vedere tale partizione di server come se fosse un server totalmente indipendente, naturalmente andando a condividere le risorse fisiche dell'hardware. tale approccio permette una elevata economicità pur mantenendo la totale autonomia nel sistema operativo installato. così come per i server dedicati, i server virtuali vengono forniti con sistema operativo linux o windows. home

"she was very expressive and articulate and passionate about it," says cole, amfar's chairman of the board since 2006. "she just didn't understand why everyone else wasn't."this was early on," he continued. "this was a time when people were fearful and distant and because as we know ronald reagan didn't mention the word aids publicly until 1987 after 40,000 people had already died."taylor's activism included congressional hearings, protests and rallies. she even posed on a cover of vanity fair in 1992 with a condom in her hand."she was a relentless crusader and pioneer," cole said.sir elton john agrees: "she earned our enduring love and respect for her compassion and her courage in standing up and speaking out about aids when others preferred to bury their heads in the sand," the singer said in a statement today.john's husband and chairman of elton john aids foundation, david furnish, calls taylor a "force of nature": "she compelled people to listen, made them respond, and urged them to act," he said. "she gave comfort to the dying, roundly condemned the stigma associated with aids, and was fiercely critical of the government's sluggish, reluctant response to the epidemic."or, as taylor herself once said, "so many people were frightened and doing so little about it. the silence was thunderous and the only way to stop that is to speak out."and for that, the world is a much better place. watch: marc talks elizabeth taylor in today's video blog share tweet share email tags/ fashion , movies , lgbt , death , for a good cause , elizabeth taylor show comments latest news swapping styles! see what it would look like if meghan markle and kate middleton traded outfits sabrina desires kim kardashian west's powerful look sionne wants gigi hadid's clean, classic style olivia munn celebrates nature with an epic spring outfit tiffany haddish's realistic outlook on designer bags will make you love her even more stefano gabbana disses former friend victoria beckham on her birthday melania and donald trump match outfits and more celeb couple style facebook instagram pinterest twitter tumblr snapchat about us faq careers contact us site map apps cookie policy show schedule shop closed captioning e! now sweepstakes advertise adchoices rss feeds e! account | people's choice got a news tip? click here e! online - your source for entertainment news, celebrities, celeb news, and celebrity gossip. check out the hottest fashion, photos, movies and tv shows! privacy policy | terms of service | independent programming report | © 2018 e! entertainment television, llc. a division of nbcuniversal. all rights reserved. fomo no more. sign up now! *email entered incorrectly. please try again by subscribing to our newsletter you agree to the privacy policy and terms of use. success! thank you for subscribing. we're sorry. an error has occurred u.s. ca u.k. au de fr u.s. e! is everywhere this content is available customized for our international audience. would you like to view this in our us edition? e! is everywhere this content is available customized for our international audience. would you like to view this in our canadian edition? e! is everywhere this content is available customized for our international audience. would you like to view this in our uk edition? e! is everywhere this content is available customized for our international audience. would you like to view this in our australian edition? e! ist überall dieser inhalt ist für internationale besucher verfügbar. möchtest du ihn in der deutschen version anschauen? e! is everywhere this content is available customized for our international audience. would you like to view this in our german edition? e! est partout une version adaptée de ce contenu est disponible pour notre public international. souhaitez-vous voir ça dans notre édition française ? e! is everywhere this content is available customized for our international audience. would you like to view this in our french edition? yes! no, thanks. yes! no, thanks. yes! no, thanks. yes! no, thanks. ja ! nein, danke. yes! no, thanks. oui! non, merci. yes! no, thanks. yes! no, thanks. yes! no, thanks. ¡si! no, gracias. yes! no, thanks. translate to english translate to english impressum translate to english > translate to english > > translate to english > this content is available customized for our international audience. switch to us edition? this content is available customized for our international audience. switch to canadian edition? this content is available customized for our international audience. switch to uk edition? this content is available customized for our international audience. switch to australian edition? möchtest du zur deutschen version wechseln? do you want to go to the german edition? souhaitez-vous vous rendre sur l'édition française ? do you want to go to the french edition? this content is available customized for our international audience. switch to us edition? ¡hemos especializado nuestro sitio para tu región! ¿quieres ir a e! online latino? we have specialized our website for your region. would you like to switch to our latino edition? yes! yes! yes! yes! ja ! yes! oui! yes! yes! yes! ¡si! yes! ✕

twitter facebook instagram soundcloud bundesliga grounded: week 12 reviewed november 18, 2010 by vampy week 12 of bundesliga brought two feisty derbies i.e. rhine, baden-württemberg and bavarian, in fixtures of fc köln vs. borussia mönchengladbach, hoffenheim vs. freiburg, and bayern munich vs. nürnberg respectively at the weekend. it was yet another super weekend filled with surprises, controversies, and some high-flying individual performances. mainz continued to derail their train off the track while borussia dortmund painted it “all yellow” with early kick-off on friday as they further extended the lead off the chasing pack. man on rise, mario gomez, showed his both sides of being mr. confidant and mr. reliable as he rallied his team and inspired them to overcome bavarian derby with fearless attitude while bayer leverkusen have emerged as serious title challengers again this season. on the other side, we witnessed six-goal-thriller in kaiserslautern as they hosted vfb stuttgart. let’s have a look at how it went on in bundesliga week 12. borussia dortmund vs. hamburger sv wounded “die rothosen” travelled to dortmund in search of something but their trip to dortmund came at the wrong time of the table. as dortmund’s unbeaten run stretched back to 10 wins and their midfield machine didn’t even look like slowing anytime, hsv got victimized. the match started well for hsv as playing away and missing many players due to injuries; they held dortmund well and kept them at the bay from scoring. the fact that few hsv players were playing out of position didn’t help it either. however, they finished the first half with score level at 0-0. dortmund were their usual-self i.e. confidant and the team with possession but concentration at the back of hsv were on high alert. this triggered the impatience symptom in klopp as he looked for some answers from his team. his frustration took toll at the near-end of the first half though, as he went ballistic on the forth official. it was a reaction to ze roberto’s tackle on mario götze and the foul was not given. in the end, dortmund ran victorious as they out-played hsv in every department and looked better team in the second half. shinji kagawa opened the scoring at the start of the second half and the second goal came out from an impressive team play and lukas barrios was the artist to put the finishing touch to that artful play. klopp has been fined for his gnawing and gnashing teeth “antics” by dfb. he will serve a touchline ban and is asked to pay 10k euros which will go in to charity, eventually. just to keep it on record, this is not the first time that klopp has been fined by dfb. the man has a history in that department. result: borussia dortmund 2-0 hsv scorer(s): kagawa, barrios wolfsburg vs. schalke 04 where to start with this match? let’s start with the start itself. felix magath’s schalke 04 travelled to his “old house” wolfsburg, the team that won bundesliga under his shrewd and disciplinarian management. as the match kicked off, wolfsburg were the better team in terms of control over the match, they took the lead via grafite’s strike in 11th minute of the match. edin dzeko doubled the league in 34th minute of the match and it looked like that trio of grafite-dzeko-diego was going to rip apart schalke’s miserable defense of the late. however, schalke managed to score a goal when edu made it 2-1 that involved some intelligent play by raul and farfan. when the second half started schalke gained the momentum and were backed by magnanimous support of their fans even when they were playing an away fixture. the second half was filled with controversies as the referee wolfgang stark completely lost the plot when schalke striker klaas-jan huntelaar controlled the ball with his arm and sent it past benaglio to level the score. another controversy followed when stark pulled out a howard webb-esque demonstration when he wrongfully gave a straight red to wolfsburg substitute dejagah, with wolfsburg one man short, schalke spent more time in the final third of the pitch but it remained fruitless till the end and both teams managed to get one point each. result: wolfsburg 2-2 schalke 04 scorer(s): grafite, dzeko—edu, huntelaar fc köln vs. borussia mönchengladbach a rhine derby, both teams flirting with relegation, both teams in dire need of points, and right time to forget the misery days was the theme of this fixture. the match was played at rheinenergiestadion, home of fc köln, but it was away side borussia mönchengladbach that went rampant and literally drilled fc köln in front of their home crowd. as expected in the derbies, the tempo of the match was set on “high red” as we saw many tackles being thrown on the full-length of the pitch. the first half formed an opinion that köln was puling all the strings but when the second half started it was mönchengladbach that cut the strings in hand of köln and took over from there. bobadilla pulled off the first goal of the match with the free-kick and concentration of köln side at loose they took advantage again to take their lead to 2-0 via goal by michael bradley which was slightly deflected on its way. relying on counter-attacks in the final half-hour of the match, borussia mönchengladbach scored the third goal when de margo showed the cross of marco reus path to goal. bobadilla completed his brace and emerged as a hero for mönchengladbach side and finished the scoring with his side winning 0-4. both teams are still placed in bottom two of the league but köln remain at the deep abyss. result: fc köln 0-4 mönchengladbach scorer(s): bobadilla (2), de margo, bradley werder bremen vs. eintracht frankfurt this match was “match of the chances” if i am allowed to demonstrate my literature-skills, if any. both team tested their many chances through-out the game but none really scored. the end-result of the match is surprising to me as werder has been awful when defending comes while frankfurt have been flying high for past weeks on the veteran shoulders of gekas who remains top scorer of the league at the moment with 11 goals. the fact that frankfurt didn’t score and werder didn’t concede was astonishing to be honest. however, both teams would be happy to share the points but werder were in need of some points there. result: werder 0-0 frankfurt scorer(s): none st. pauli vs. bayer leverkusen 04 the millerntor, home of st. pauli, had never been an easy place to be for leverkusen as they never had won there. however, jupp heynckes added another “historic accomplishment” in his commendable cv as he guided his side to their first ever victory at the millerntor. start of the match bore some ill tidings for leverkusen as they were facing some difficulties to break st. pauli but soon they took control and created many chances which were not converted. st. pauli dragged leverkusen till the end and draw looked likely but match nearing to end leverkusen demonstrated how to break the opponents with exceptional set-pieces when nothing is working. renato augusto scored when vidal took free kick and sent a long ball in to the box which was headed by simon rolfes to anticipating augusto and augusto made no mistake this time. werkself sit second on the league table sharing the points with mainz and seven points behind the current leaders, borussia dortmund. result: st. pauli 0-1 bayer leverkusen scorer(s): renato augusto kaiserslautern vs. vfb stuttgart this match proved a top-drawer of the weekend as it involved six goals and redefined some mental attributes of the both sides. stuttgart took the lead with one of the joyful goals this season when boka came rushing in the lauetrn’s heart of defense and set marica for one-two and scoring the goal with a deft touch. cacau scored the second goal for stuttgart and the match looked buried for kaiserslautern when gentner made it 0-3 for the swabians. however, kaiserslautern pulled off “istanbul moment” of their own when they raced back, showed courage, and displayed unbeatable character to level the game at 3-3 again. their counter-attack tactic played some part in their clawing back into the match. it was tiffert who orchestrated the might comeback of kaiserslautern. first, his cross was netted in by micanski to make it 1-3 nearing an hour mark. ilicevic gave hope to home crowd when he converted an impressive left-footed strike in to goal to bring the score to 2-3 and it took only two minutes more that kaiserslautern were level at 3-3, when mathias abel headed in the free-kick of tiffert. result: kaiserslautern 3-3 stuttgart scorer(s): micanski, ilicevic, abel—boka, cacau, gentner mainz vs. hannover things were all rosy for mainz when they started the league and went to win it all and were all set to not looking back at all but now the bed of roses has been turned in to bed of thorns as they have recorded four losses in their last five fixtures. something tells that they also want to level the record of futility in bundesliga and score some losses for that. this last match, a late kick-off, on saturday was a test of ambitions for the both sides’ ambitions and at the end hannover left a strong mark with an impressive well-controlled victory despite being 10-men for last 20 minutes of the game. it took a powerful strike of sergio pinto from way off 30-yards to break the spine of mainz and that goal proved the only goal of the match that separated the sides from winners and losers, eventually. result: mainz 0-1 hannover scorer(s): pinto 1899 hoffenheim vs. sc freiburg freiburg registered their fourth win of their last six games to climb up the league standings to clinch the fourth spot. the match standing at a goalless draw for 90 minutes, cisse scored his 10th of the season to give freiburg a victory at the stoppage time. cisse has been proving pivotal for freiburg and he has been constantly providing the team with his knack of the goals. apart from goal that ensured freiburg victory, it was gylfi sigurdsson who remained constant threat for freiburg defense with his amazing performance. he was playing like mozart but just lacked the finishing touches to most of his moves and shots. with little grooming and guidance, this icelandic midfielder has potential to be a great bundesliga player. result: hoffenheim 0-1 freiburg scorer(s): cisse bayern münchen vs. nürnberg it is safe to assume now that bayern munich are back on winning ways as they won this bavarian derby, on sunday. they were well-drilled in the midfield and controlled the match off-the-start and rightfully took an early lead when “new-born” mario gomez scored from daniel pranjic’s by-line grounded-cross just 10 minutes in to the game. from then on, it proved a night for daniel pranjic and mario gomez both as they caused difficulties and chaos for nürnberg at the back. gomez was brought down by schafer in the penalty box and the referee rightfully pointed to the penalty spot. phillip lahm took the penalty and slotted it in with much ease to make it 2-0. it looked like that all bayern munich players had some dose of high-tempo tendencies before the match as it looked evident from their dominance in the match. the match marked a return of ribery and had a good run-up in the match as he looked in better shape. he provided an assist from corner for gomez’ second of the night which he slotted in perfectly with a diving header. “unbelievable, i wanted to slap him but that wouldn’t have helped us.” this only shows that how schweini has gone a massive transformation and the level of maturity he has gained in these years. bayern munich were given another penalty and all team gave gomez a chance to complete another hat-trick but what he did was he blasted the ball high in the crowd as if he was asked to send the ball not into the net but to berlin! the looks of things tell that bayern munich will increase the pressure on other sides as they are looking their usual-self now and will weave some victories down the road in coming weeks but their next match can be proven a dent to their aspirations as they face high-flying and in-form bayer leverkusen side in their next match. that fixture will tell all the story of how much bayern munich look serious in going ahead. result: bayern munich 3-0 nürnberg scorer(s): gomez (2), lahm

3 дня. это раз. по поводу писем, первое письмо об увеличении ставки было отправлено мне 15 июля, по каким-то почтовым причинам я получил его утром 24-го. и в нем было написано, что ставка поднимается и о новом размере ежемесячного платежа я буду уведомлен следующим письмом. при этом не было указано, увеличение ставки касается текущего платежа, который на следующий день или следующего. на всякий случай я помчался в банк и менеджер сказала, что это касается уже текущего платежа. я оперативно довнес лаве. то есть, если бы я получил даже первое письмо 24 вечером, то я бы уже попал на просрочку хотя бы на один день. доп соглашение мне никто подписывать не предлагал, просто есть ссылка на соотв. пункт договора. как манагер, 11 лет проработавший в банках на разных должностях, могу сказать, что такая работа - полная туфта. я понимаю, что сейчас не те условия, в которых работал я, и количество клиентов выросло в разы, но разруха не в клозетах, а в головах. банковская система должна работать как часы. тем более за 30 процентов годовых в долларе. хотя в этой стране я уже ничему не удивляюсь. вернуться к началу aishvari думающий сообщения: 54 зарегистрирован: пт июн 13, 2008 7:49 pm цитата сообщение aishvari » вт авг 05, 2008 8:12 pm ну к сожалению у нас такой сервис, редкая компания сейчас может похвастаться хорошим. все же в головах у большинства что обслуживать- стыдно. вернуться к началу drooppy оракул сообщения: 1725 зарегистрирован: чт янв 20, 2005 11:40 am откуда: киев контактная информация: контактная информация пользователя drooppy сайт re: цитата сообщение drooppy » ср авг 06, 2008 12:02 pm miura писал(а):банковская система должна работать как часы. тем более за 30 процентов годовых в долларе. хотя в этой стране я уже ничему не удивляюсь. +10 при всей красоте рекламных компаний работа поставлена мягко говоря неадекватно. и именно это портит впечатление клиента о банке. мне как клиенту глубоко все равно, какие трудности у банка. если он находит возможным в отличие от многих других банков поднять процентную ставку до 30%, значит пусть обеспечивает клиенту должный сервис и обслуживание. каждое посещение отделения банка может отнять от 20 минут и до обеда. куча всяческих ограничений и лимитов. при этом менеджеры часто забывают о них упоминать. чтобы снять больше 10000 грн. надо видите ли заказывать деньги. цирк. а последний хит, от которого меня порвало на части, это то, что их система е-банкинга не работает с windows vista !!!! бедный билл гейтс, он даже не догадывается, какую туфту он создал, что с его системой не работает сам универсал банк! перечислять "заслуги" этого уникального банка можно долго. на лицо факт того, что банковская система в украине не развивается в вопросе качества обслуживания частных лиц. и это при том, что именно розница дает банкам ощутимый доход и прирост. p.s. еще мне очень нравится отношение наших банков к своим же клиентам, когда у последних происходит страховое событие. такое ощущение, что клиент превращается во врага народа. банк то норовит затянуть с ответом, то себе деньги забрать, то еще какую-то гадость отмочить. и что мне нравится - всегда все умничают и ссылаются на условия договоров. все это хорошо и правильно, только почему-то все забывают, что это живой клиент и от поведения и отношения банка будет зависеть его отношения к этому банку, кредитам и финансовым учреждениям в целом. стоимость каско в разных компаниях для разных банков вернуться к началу santos думающий сообщения: 60 зарегистрирован: чт авг 07, 2008 12:42 pm контактная информация: контактная информация пользователя santos icq сайт цитата сообщение santos » пт сен 12, 2008 3:15 pm в этом банке работают в основном молодеж, которая еще учится, поэтому наберитесь терпения, есть в этом плюсы: вам не нахомят как в ощадбанке и других крупных типа аваль, там меньше коммисия, пока мало клиентов поэтому очереди почти нет, узнают в лицо, это приятно но и др. важно то что они современные, много технологических новшеств, ну не работают с вистой, а кто с ней работает? знакомые айтишники говорят ирунда, почему ставят на компы? посмотрите, где продают все готовое + виста, замануха от билла или досталась на шару. и главное плохая защита от вирусов. ставлю 9 этому банку. вернуться к началу drooppy оракул сообщения: 1725 зарегистрирован: чт янв 20, 2005 11:40 am откуда: киев контактная информация: контактная информация пользователя drooppy сайт re: цитата сообщение drooppy » пн сен 15, 2008 10:37 am santos писал(а):знакомые айтишники говорят ирунда, почему ставят на компы? посмотрите, где продают все готовое + виста, замануха от билла или досталась на шару. и главное плохая защита от вирусов. ставлю 9 этому банку. santos, вопрос не в висте, а в том, что европейский банк банально не может сделать удобной одну из наиболее актуальных услуг -

__label__low le monde comme il va aller au contenu | aller au menu | aller à la recherche « quand macron cite deng en pensant à mao - la comédie humaine du travail » tunisie, la révolution et son fantôme par patsy le lundi, février 8 2016, 22:18 - actualité internationale - lien permanent en ce mois de février 2016, j'ai une pensée pour ce jeune marocain qui, un jour de décembre 2010, las des humiliations, s'est immolé par le feu dans sa ville de sidi bouzid. j'ai une pensée pour toi, mohammed bouazizi, dont le suicide a provoqué la chute de ben ali et, dans son sillage, a entraîné la jeunesse d'autres pays arabes à lever haut le drapeau de l'émancipation politique et sociale. car tu n'as pas seulement mis le feu à tes vêtements. tu as embrasé la tunisie entière. et la colère a dépassé les frontières, montrant à quel point certains régimes autoritaires n'étaient que des tigres de papier. du moins, beaucoup le pensaient ; d'autres n'y croyaient pas mais espéraient quand même que bouazizi et tant d'autres ne soient pas morts pour rien. fêter la révolution cinq ans après ? fêter quoi au juste ? car de révolution, il n'y a pas eu. tout changer pour que rien ne change alors ? cela y ressemble fort, même si rien n'est aussi fixiste. la tunisie est citée en exemple, puisqu'elle n'a pas sombré dans la violence. on comprend pourquoi. le pouvoir égyptien a renoué avec la violence d’état et la répression tout azimut. au nom de l'ordre et de la sécurité, on liquide du barbu et du démocrate indocile au son de l'hymne national. la guerre civile n'est jamais propre. celle-ci est sale et se fait avec les armes qu'on leur vend. au moment où ben ali était chahuté par la foule, la droite française au pouvoir, par la voix de michèle alliot-marie, lui proposait des flics et son expertise en matière de maintien de l'ordre. la gauche au pouvoir est moins obscène : elle vend des armes aux massacreurs galonnés égyptiens au nom de la démocratie et de la balance commerciale. choisissez votre camp… pauvre tunisie. au début du mois de janvier, le premier parti du pays, nidaa tounes, s'est donné en spectacle. tout le monde s'est battu comme des chiffonniers pour trouver le futur leader de l'organisation chargé de remplacer son vieillard de fondateur, béji caïd essebsi, nonagénaire autocrate. et comme dans un mauvais film, le vieillard a tapé du poing sur la table et a décrété que la seule personne susceptible de le remplacer à terme ne pouvait être que son fils, hafedh caïd essebsi. on doit appeler ça de la démocratie héréditaire. pauvre tunisie. au nom de la réconciliation nationale, béji caïd essebsi a permis à d'anciens membres du parti de ben ali, le rassemblement constitutionnel démocratique, d'intégrer nidaa tounès et d'y refaire leur beurre comme si de rien n'était. normal après tout puisqu'il y a fait lui-même toute sa carrière politique. nidaa tounès n'est pas un parti, c'est une entreprise de recyclage d'opportunistes, d'arrivistes et de mafieux. pauvre tunisie. au nom de la réconciliation nationale, béji caïd essebsi a fait de son principal adversaire politique, l'islamiste rached ghannouchi, l'invité d'honneur du congrès. geste fort qui sent l'union sacrée ou la version musulmane de l'alliance du sabre et du goupillon. pauvre tunisie. au nom de la réconciliation nationale, béji caïd essebsi est favorable au vote d'une loi protégeant des rigueurs de la justice les affairistes et autres kleptocrates qui ont fait leur beurre sous les ailes protectrices de l'ancien régime. comme dans la france de la libération, il s'agit d'épurer, mais pas trop. comme dans la france de françois hollande, il ne faut pas désespérer neuilly et la défense. c'est pour cette tunisie-là que mohammed bouazizi s'est suicidé ? c'est pour un tel résultat que des centaines ou des milliers de tunisiens ont été tués, humiliés, bastonnés ? la tunisie a vécu ce que certains politistes appellent un phénomène de décompression autoritaire. les élites au pouvoir lâchent du lest, ouvrent l'accès au pouvoir et à ses ressources à d'anciens dominés. l'élite se recompose ainsi, intégrant des outsiders dans son pré-carré où politique et business se tiennent par la main. la décompression autoritaire est suivi souvent de la restauration autoritaire quand le pouvoir, sorti de son état de grâce, est obligé de mater ces peuples rêvant de démocratie sociale et n'acceptant pas d'être les dindons d'une farce au goût amer. car rien n'a changé pour ceux qui ont un contrat de travail comme pour ceux qui vivotent dans l'informel, dans les trafics transfrontaliers, dans l'économie parallèle. comme tous les peuples, les tunisiens auront droit à la même potion : restauration de l'autorité de l’état d'un côté, ordre moral de l'autre. le sabre et le misbaha, le chapelet musulman. la tunisie crève à petit feu. la jeunesse tunisienne se meurt d'ennui, de misère et de frustrations. plutôt que de pourrir sur place, certains ont fait le choix de l'exil, ont pris la route, direction l'eldorado européen. plutôt que de mourir sur place, d'autres ont choisi de tuer et de se faire tuer au nom d'allah, au nom du califat, au nom de l'oummah. ils sont des milliers à avoir rejoint daech en syrie et surtout en libye et dans le sahel. la tunisie est le premier exportateur mondial de djihadistes. et ils seront plus nombreux encore demain si la situation sociale se détériore. rechercher accueil - archivescatégoriesnotes de lecturequestion socialehistoire, textes historiquesactualité politiqueactualité internationalesociététagsafrique anarchisme capitalisme chine conditions de travail démocratie bourgeoise ecologie egypte etat etats-unis europe guerre d espagne irak israël management nationalisme religion syndicalisme syrie tunisie tous les tags s'abonnerfil des billetsfil des commentaires propulsé par dotclear

качество известные бренды находятся на слуху у многих людей. брендовые товары во все времена являются эталоном качества. многие фирмы зачастую стремятся к славе своих конкурентов, но это сделать нелегко. с каждым выпуском своей новой продукции они раз за разом подтверждают свое высокое звание. очень трудно найти магазин, где собрано достаточное количество наиболее известных брендовых моделей.

миллионы нервных окончаний, и правильное их стимулирование отражается на работу всего нашего организма в целом. детская стопа растет в среднем до 7 лет, и на этапе своего развития и становления стоит ей помочь в этом. покупая правильную обувь, вы решаете многие проблемы со здоровьем. обратите внимание на известные марки, которые производят детскую отличную и красивую обувь. это, например, adidas,

обуви у таких фирм как blink, bronx, evita, belmondo, s.olive. для мужчин на наших страницах тоже имеется достаточно предложений. это могут быть классические модели для тех, кто привык подчиняться

можем вам предложить для обозрения. и врядли найдутся люди, которые не знают такие мировые имена со своей историей как reebok, puma, nike, adidas. каталог

__label__low skip to main | skip to sidebar jueves, octubre 26, 2006 el embargo del logroñés primera posibilidad: esta noticia (pinchar sobre la imagen para ampliarla) publicada hoy por diario la rioja ha saltado todas las alarmas, especulaciones y dudas en torno a la situación del cd logroñés, el histórico que parece nunca podrá salir del culebrón que significan las deudas. según ha podido saber el editor de este blog, el embargo viene por parte de una reclamación de varios ex jugadores de la temporada 2003/2004, con los que parecía haberse solucionado el tema allá por julio. sin embargo, el cd logroñés presentó varios avales y, entre ellos, acreditó dinero procedente de varios juzgados que iría destinado al juzgado de lo social para saldar esta deuda. sin embargo, llegado el momento de hacer efectivo el aval, la asociación de futbolistas españoles (afe) se ha encontrado con un problema: no puede cobrar. de seguir así, y si el logroñés no cumple con su obligación podrían quedarle suspendidos los derechos federativos, lo que se traduce en no poder dar de alta ninguna ficha nueva, ni siquiera de un posible nuevo entrenador en caso de que se decidiera destituir al actual. esto es lo que, en este instante, el abajo firmante ha logrado averiguar. de todos modos, esto no es sino un error gave de afe, ya que de confirmarse estos hechos, el sindicato de futbolistas habría confiado en un aval que ahora no puede cobrar.segunda posibilidad: todos los que vivimos de cerca el caso de la deuda en afe, nos extrañamos con la cantidad que dijo abonar el cd logroñés. según una sentencia judicial, el club estaba obligado a pagar a sus ex jugadores de la temporada 2003/2004 una cantidad de 449.436 euros más los intereses creados. sin embargo, llegado el momento de la verdad, el gerente blanquirrojo, josé lópez pérez, en declaraciones a mí en diario la rioja, decía lo siguiente: «hemos cumplido con una cantidad de 350.000 euros, que es lo que nos pedía afe. ahora, lo que hay que hacer es esperar a que no pase nada extraño y podamos seguir con nuestro camino». es decir, faltan casi 100.000 euros hasta alcanzar el montante total de lo reclamado por el juzgado de lo social. descontando lo que el club debía a edu garcía, fernando marín, ramón y candelas, con los que llegó a un acuerdo, ¿podríamos estar ante los 90.813 euros que reclaman (si dejamos al margen, claro, los 70.993 que se le reclaman en intereses y costes)? ahí está la cuestión.en cualquier caso, si alguno de los datos aportados no fuese del todo correcto, no duden que el editor de este blog rectificará de inmediato. ¿pueden aportar algo? ahí tienen los comentarios, todos suyos.actualización, 17.45 horas: inclínense por la segunda posibilidad ;)actualización, 21.24 horas: anoten y subrayen la siguiente palabra: retención. publicado por j.l. garcía íñiguez en 10/26/2006 05:24:00 p. m. 2 comentarios: enlaces a esta entrada sábado, octubre 21, 2006 ¿no habrá sido usted, míster? fabio capello: "robinho ha cambiado" publicado por j.l. garcía íñiguez en 10/21/2006 01:25:00 p. m. 1 comentario: enlaces a esta entrada martes, octubre 10, 2006 ¿y qué hay del logroñés club de fútbol? el logroñés club de fútbol, club rodeado de la polémica surgida por su denominación, vive en aparente tranquilidad en el grupo ii de segunda b. tras vencer al histórico club deportivo logroñés en el derbi (1-0) el pasado 10 de septiembre, los rojiblancos que preside eduardo blanco asestaron el segundo puñetazo en el rostro del histórico, con una victoria judicial hace diez días que les permite utilizar la denominación de logroñés.pero, problemáticas extradeportivas aparte, el logroñés cf confeccionó este verano una plantilla muy fuerte este verano. todas aquellas personas ajenas a logroño con las que he podido hablar me han asegurado que los riojanos tienen equipo para aspirar al ascenso a segunda división. sin embargo, tras siete jornadas ligueras parece o que el equipo está aún en fase de construcción o que los pronósticos son desacertados.cierto es que la plantilla cuenta con hombres importantes, como los ex primera martín vellisca, ibón begoña y miguel escalona, pero, hasta ahora, el equipo no está en la zona alta de la clasificación. suman nueve puntos en siete jornadas y ocupan el decimotercer puesto de la tabla. algo falla en el esquema de balta sánchez (ex histórico de la ud salamanca y ex entrenador del zamora) al que, según parece, sus jugadores no acaban de captar su preciosista idea del juego. balta, que otra cosa no, pero honrado es un rato, se desvive en cada partido, es un técnico exigente y consciente de que tiene ante sí un reto importante.en voz alta, nadie en el logroñés cf afirma que el objetivo es el ascenso, pero esa meta vive latente en el antiguo recreación. por tanto, la actual clasificación no puede ser considerada como fracaso (tal y como ocurrió la pasada temporada, con tres técnicos diferentes en el banquillo de las gaunas), pero sí se le debe exigir más a un equipo que se autoproclama como futuro del fútbol riojano. publicado por j.l. garcía íñiguez en 10/10/2006 01:09:00 p. m. no hay comentarios: enlaces a esta entrada la respuesta al viaje del logroñés a guinea quique setién pasó ayer por el larguero y explicó qué hacía el club deportivo logroñés en guinea ecuatorial. un convenio con el país africano para la formación de jugadores parece ser la respuesta. pero, mejor lo escuchas tú mismo pinchando aquí. publicado por j.l. garcía íñiguez en 10/10/2006 07:34:00 a. m. 10 comentarios: enlaces a esta entrada lunes, octubre 09, 2006 miguel ángel lotina: el eterno candidato de un tiempo a esta parte, cuando un entrenador vive en la cuerda floja, suele aparecer el mismo protagonista como posible sustituto. se trata de miguel ángel lotina, ahora candidato a ocupar el cargo de seleccionador de españa. no tenemos que remontarnos mucho, tan sólo a este verano, cuando lotina fue posible sucesor de dos técnicos. cuando javier clemente fue invitado a abandonar san mamés, apareció el ex jugador del cd logroñés como posible técnico del athletic, aunque, finalmente, el elegido fue félix sarriugarte. ¿recuerdan cuando lópez caro no terminaba de cerrar su incorporación al levante ya que tenía contrato con el racing de santander? pues entonces, la segunda opción del club valenciano por si fallaba el ex del real madrid era, quién si no, lotina. ahora, a la opción de ser seleccionador, se suma la de sustituir a miguel ángel portugal, técnico en riesgo en el racing. en definitiva, o lotina es un técnico que se vende muy bien o todos los directivos observan unas grandes cualidades en el ex entrenador del numancia, logroñés, osasuna, celta y espanyol. publicado por j.l. garcía íñiguez en 10/09/2006 08:50:00 p. m. no hay comentarios: enlaces a esta entrada ¿qué hace el logroñés en guinea? tal y como explicó ayer diario la rioja, una expedición del cd logroñés ha viajado hasta guinea ecuatorial. el fin del viaje está aún por conocer, al margen de que josé lópez pérez, preparador físico y gerente del logroñés, se está encargando de la preparación física de los guineanos, ayudando así a quique setién, recién nombrado seleccionador de fútbol del país africano.de esta forma, mientras el club blanquirrojo sumó ayer una dolorosísima derrota en barakaldo que le deja como colista en el grupo ii de segunda b, su cúpula estuvo la semana pasada en guinea. pero, ¿qué hacía allí el propietario del logroñés, juan hortelano? ¿buscar jugadores? un momento, no puede ser, porque en segunda b no pueden jugar extracomunitarios. entonces, quizá, ¿buscaba financiación? el dinero en guinea es casi patrimonio exclusivo de teodoro obiang nguema, dictador del país desde 1979. su hijo, rouland obiang nguema, es el director general de deportes de guinea y ya estuvo presente en el encuentro que el conjunto riojano disputó ante la selección africana, el pasado 23 de agosto, en las gaunas. es más, incluso sale, junto a la plantilla, cuerpo técnico y directiva, en la fotografía oficial del cd logroñés de esta temporada.pero, ¿quién es teodoro obiang? ¿sería lícita moralmente una financiación de este tipo? wikipedia nos explica cómo las gasta el tal obiang nguema:"obiang lidera actualmente una de las más corruptas, etnocéntricas, opresivas y antidemocráticas dictaduras del mundo, de acuerdo a observadores nacionales y extranjeros. el país tiene un partido único: el partido democrático de guinea ecuatorial o pdge. posee 98 de los 100 escaños del parlamento nacional. obiang fue reelegido en diciembre de 2002 en unas elecciones boicoteadas por la oposición. en julio de 2003 la radio estatal áfrica 2000 anunció que el presidente es un dios que está en permanente contacto con el todopoderoso y puede matar a cualquiera "sin que nadie le pida cuentas y sin ir al infierno porque es el dios mismo".actualización: el diario montañés habla de quique setién y aporta nuevos detalles sobre la expedición del logroñés en guinea ecuatorial. según el diario cántabro, el viaje de los emisarios blanquirrojos estaría patrocinado por coca-cola y embutidos pepe campos, entre otros.actualización ii: el diario as ya mencionaba tanto a coca-cola como a embutidos pepe campos, aunque afirma que su patrocinio es sobre la potenciación en torno al fútbol que se está llevando a cabo en guinea. ¿alguien puede aportar algo nuevo?

__label__low toggle navigation 首页 美国旅游 加拿大旅游 游记攻略 简繁 首页 加拿大游记 加拿大资讯游记 加拿大建民房像“搭积木” 作者：喜行于摄 阅读数：389 发布：2016-11-03 01:38:54 分享 字号 100% 加拿大建民房像“搭积木” 2015-07-17 09:39 喜行于摄 阅读 0 加拿大的房子采用的都是轻质材料，从支架到里外墙，再到门窗都是从“超市”里买来的半成品。回来以后简单的组装一下，就把房子搞定了，整个过程像小朋友搭积木一样。“搭积木”的好处是：住宅和施工过程绿色环保；建筑材料集约化；地震海啸飓风等自然灾害导致房屋倒塌对人类的伤害较少。001.支架是黑色的木头架子，墙体是合成的板材，施工过程就是一个“搭积木”的过程。没有砖混结构的麻烦事，根本杜绝了取土，垒墙，上房梁等“大兴土木”的一套做法.002.具体一点，一般在3层以下的房子，大架子大部分是木架子的结构，钢筋水泥结构的较少；墙体分成三个夹层，中间是保温层，里面是装饰层，外面的砖墙或石头墙并不直接承重，只起到美化和保暖作用。003.高层的住宅的大架子是钢筋水泥的，但建筑方式也还是“搭积木”，墙体的大部分都是“半成品”的原材料，用吊车组合就可以了。004.加拿大地处北方，冬季寒冷。民房要保暖，中间是像“海绵”一样的夹层，外贴一层承重和保暖的“硬壳”。005.这种材料较轻，隔音保暖性能好。006.房子上下包括阳台的框架基本都是木头的，加拿大木材多的是，这点我们学不了。其实，加拿大的土地也多的是，取土烧砖盖房子是没有问题的。这些木制建筑材料也是从市场买来的，不是民间自己搞的。007.地基部分的像面包一样的带气的混合墙体，有很好的保暖性能。不然的话怎能抵抗零下30多度的严寒啊！008.墙体搭完以后，开始搭窗户。窗户是一个整体来的，窗子本身和窗口很难拆卸，擦玻璃时，窗子只能推拉，不能卸下来。009.窗子封闭很严，基本不进灰尘。进人更不用想了，除非要把窗口整体卸下来。010.三下五除二，积木没有几天就搭玩了。一个“家”的雏形出来了！011.加拿大的房子外墙上基本没有贴瓷砖的，里面也少有糊墙纸壁纸一类的装饰。但外墙的装饰砖或“石头”非常坚固，基本上是“50年不变，100年不动摇”。讲究的就是“实惠”。 012.“搭积木”看似简单，其实也有一套严格的施工流程。电线，电话线，网线，水，煤气等一律预先藏好在墙体内。各种计量表该留在外边就在外边了。013.加拿大的“搭积木”施工比较环保，工地上有一个大铁箱子，装垃圾的了。完事以后，大箱子被汽车拖走，工地上干干净净。这与大量使用“半成品”有直接的关系。014.几乎所有的房子都是采用的“搭积木”的生产方式。015.穿上“衣服”以后，一个崭新的“家”就造好了。外墙的装饰砖因个人的喜好可作不同的选择。016.“搭积木”是造房子的一种形式，实质是生产方式的转变。材料的集约化显而易见，这些东西没有装瓦砂石“硬”。实践证明，一旦房屋倒塌，轻质材料对人的伤害很小；而且也容易施救。017.推挤如山的“半成品”。018.愿我们早日告别造房子的“大兴土木”的砖混时代，也玩起“搭积木”。 分享此文章 文章景点/城市 卡尔加里多伦多渥太华温哥华蒙特利尔 相关景点 加拿大资讯最新游记/攻略 “建国”喊你逛公园！2017加拿大国家公园免费入园申请办法 天宝旅游，加拿大旅行社，加中旅游，玩哪儿订购超值 多伦多交通攻略 – 详解多伦多旅游交通 穿越加拿大——宜居城市温哥华 – 自驾攻略 夏末说走就走的加拿大落基山之旅–准备篇 加拿大建民房像“搭积木” 加拿大大雁与人和谐共处 加拿大已经150岁啦，再不去看看你也老了 分享到微信 请在移动设备上打开微信“扫一扫”功能并扫描下面的二维码，待微信打开网页后点击屏幕右上角分享按钮 我知道了 首页 台湾 体育 图片 微博 新闻 美国 财经 移民 论坛 大陆 娱乐 健康 博客 北美新浪旅遊 北美新浪旅游频道微博账号 关注 北美最专业的游记攻略 powered by 美国旅游 美国餐馆 加拿大旅游 墨西哥旅游 古巴旅游 波多黎各旅游 美东旅游 美西旅游 黄石公园 纽约旅游 波士顿旅游 华盛顿旅游 费城旅游 洛杉矶旅游 旧金山旅游 纵横旅游 海鸥假期 天马旅游 拉斯维加斯旅游 西雅图旅游 芝加哥旅游 丹佛旅游 盐湖城旅游 迈阿密旅游 奥兰多旅游 夏威夷旅游 檀香山旅游 阿拉斯加旅游 黄石小木屋 尼亚加拉大瀑布 大峡谷旅游 羚羊谷旅游 羚羊谷门票 羚羊谷一日游 大峡谷一日游 优胜美地一日游 拉斯维加斯一日游 黄刀镇极光旅游 阿拉斯加极光 圣胡安旅游 美国亚洲旅行社 纽约一日游 温哥华旅游多伦多旅游卡尔加里旅游蒙特利尔旅游黄刀镇旅游邮轮us toursnew york tourslos angeles tourslas vegas tourssan francisco tourswashington dc toursseattle toursboston toursorlando toursphiladelphia toursmiami toursvancouver tourstoronto toursantelope canyon ticketgrand canyon toursniagara falls tours纽约到大瀑布 多伦多到大瀑布 波士顿到大瀑布 华盛顿到大瀑布 洛杉矶到黄石公园 旧金山到黄石公园 拉斯维加斯到黄石公园 拉斯维加斯到大峡谷 拉斯维加斯到羚羊谷 丹佛到黄石公园 盐湖城到黄石公园 卡尔加里到班夫公园 班夫公园旅游 温哥华到班夫 美国国家公园 纽约包车 旧金山包车 拉斯维加斯包车 洛杉矶包车 迈阿密包车 西雅图包车 波士顿包车 布法罗包车 芝加哥包车 夏威夷包车 华盛顿包车 卡尔加里包车 蒙特利尔包车 多伦多包车 温哥华包车 新浪简介 | about sina | 广告服务 | sina english | 使用条款 | 隐私保护 copyright © 1996-2016 sina corporation, all rights reserved.

lovely overnight stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary! it was a cheap deal but you wouldn't have guessed it. the staff could not have been more charming and the room was great - 'suitably luxurious'! and you can't fault the location! the bar was a bit quirky but ver reasonably priced for a hotel bar. unfortunately the breakfast on sunday really let down the whole experience. sunday. breakfast should be relaxing but the spread was not replenished quickly enough, we went and found the coffee pot (what were all those staff doing?) and the toaster broke - so they turned it off. boo hiss, what is british breakfast without toast? the pineapple was raw and manky rather than fresh. i don't like cooked breakfast and am not particularly demanding on this front but felt let down. get your standards up guys - if you are paying £250 plus per night including the buffet breakfast it really should be a lot better than this. nice smiles from casual staff are simply not enough!room tip:

rooms from secret hotels on lastminute.com. i was told its amazing and i would be over the moon with this hotel. once checked in we went to the room to find how bad it is. the rooms are very small and have a smell about them. terrible beds and the floors are so bad that you almost feel they will cave in. i'm very disappointed with this. the carpets are so old and the door frames are so battered they are filled in with some kind of filler which give a bad impression. we had to have our room changed to a slightly bigger one. but the above still stands. i was told that i'm laying for location. well let me tell you. i have stayed in cheaper and better hotels in the vicinity. if i'm going to compare the rooms. i would say they are like a bed and breakfast you get on a seaside. but they are sometimes better. i think the radian blu in leicester ws is far better and at the time cheaper. my mistake. i wouldn't stay here for even half the price. that was 250.00 per night no breakfast. well i'm on my birthday so better get pity and find some better places to drink and have a good time. stayed: november 2013, travelled with friendsask swindon1313 about le meridien piccadilly2 thank

__label__low ask_midwife professional midwife – it's all about midwife menu skip to content contact us about post navigation ← gangguan menstruasi gangguan kehamilan yang sering terjadi → kehamilan dan virus a h1n1 posted on march 23, 2011 by ask_midwife 0 pengertian ﻿﻿ virus influenza a (h1n1) ini awalnya diberi nama flu babi (swine flu) merupakan virus influenza terbaru yang menyebabkan penyakit pada manusia. virus influenza a-h1n1 adalah jenis penyakit pernafasan yang berbeda dengan virus yang menyerang sekelompok babi di amerika utara. virus ini memiliki dua gen dari virus flu yang normalnya menyerang babi di eropa dan asia, burung (avian) dan manusia. para peneliti menyebutnya sebagai quadruple reassortant virus. (centers for disease control and prevention, 2009) menurut beberapa sumber, virus ini disebut sebagai virus jenis baru yang disebabkan oleh influenza tipe a subtipe a-h1n1 yang merupakan kombinasi antara influenza a, flu burung, dan flu manusia. oleh karena itu, who dan badan pangan dunia (fao) melakukan penggantian nama dari flu babi menjadi influenza a karena virus ini tidak lagi ditularkan dari babi ke manusia namun lebih kepada manusia ke manusia dengan penyebaran yang cukup pesat seperti pada influenza biasa. perubahan nama ini sekaligus meluruskan opini publik bahwa penyakit ini tidak ada kaitannya dengan babi, terutama dalam penularannya. dengan kata lain, babi bukan merupakan sumber penularan penyakit yang saat ini mewabah diberbagai negara. tanda dan gejala wanita hamil yang terinfeksi virus influenza a (h1n1) memiliki gejala khas pernapasan akut seperti penyakit influenza biasa (misalnya, batuk, sakit tenggorokan, hidung berair) dan demam. gejala lain dapat termasuk sakit badan, sakit kepala, kelelahan, muntah dan diare. (center for disease control and prevention, 2009) gejala influenza a ini memang sama dengan influenza pada umumnya. gejala meliputi demam, batuk, nyeri tenggorokan, body aches, sakit kepala, menggigil dan lemas atau letih. beberapa orang yang terserang flu babi juga dilaporkan mengalami pilek, sakit kepala, mual muntah, dan diare. oleh karena gejala-gejala ini tidak spesifik untuk virus influenza a, diagnosis banding dari kemungkinan influenza a tidak hanya dari gejala namun juga kecenderungan tinggi influenza a tersebut berdasarkan riwayat pasien saat ini. diagnosis pasti influenza a memerlukan uji laboratorium melalui sampel dari respirasi (usap hidung dan tenggorokan sederhana). penularan untuk virus influenza a (h1n1) yang tergolong virus baru ini penularan lebih sering terjadi dari manusia ke manusia yang cara penularannya hampir sama dengan cara penularan flu biasa, yaitu melalui udara dan kontak langsung dengan penderita. penularan melalui udara dari sekresi (cairan atau lendir) mulut dan hidung seperti batuk, bersin, berbicara, dan bernyanyi. penularan virus a (h1n1) serupa dengan virus tipe a subtipe h dan n yang bersifat zoonosis, yakni bersifat airbone lewat droplet atau cairan dari alat pernafasan seperti hidung dan mulut. penularan khusus dapat berlangsung lewat kontak langsung, melalui batuk atau bersin berjarak 1,5 meter. manusia juga dapat terinfeksi karena menyentuh benda yang telah terkontaminasi virus flu babi dari orang lain, kemudian memegang mulut, hidung, atau mata. menurut rahmansyah (2009), penularan virus ini terjadi sangat cepat (3-7 hari setelah gejala awal) dan resiko lebih tinggi jika terjadi di ruang tertutup (seperti kamar, ruang perawatan, sekolah, perawatan di rumah, dan ruang darurat). namun, penularan flu babi varian baru ini juga bergantung pada daya tahan tubuh seseorang. orang yang daya tahan tubuhnya kuat maka tidak akan mudah terjangkiti virus influenza a ini. selain itu, perlu diketahui bahwa konsumsi daging babi bukan jalan penularan penyakit ini. virus influenza a (h1n1) yang ada pada babi dapat mati setelah daging diolah dengan matang atau dimasak pada suhu minimal 70o c dan sesuai dengan panduan umum mengolah daging. (rahmansyah, 2009). pengaruh influenza a terhadap kehamilan karena respon imun ibu tertekan selama kehamilan, untuk meningkatkan penerimaan janin, maka wanita hamil menjadi lebih rentan terhadap infeksi. oleh karena itu, pada kasus penyebaran influenza a wanita hamil menjadi perhatian khusus karena termasuk ke dalam kelompok yang rentan terkena infeksi virus influenza a ini. pada kehamilan, terjadi perubahan pada respon imun ibu. sistem imun adalah suatu jaringan rumit sel khusus dan sinyal kimiawi, yang berinteraksi untuk membentuk pertahanan terhadap organisme infeksiosa. sejumlah mikroorganisme berada di dalam tubuh. sebagian, yang disebut komensal, terdapat di dalam atau pada tubuh pejamu tanpa menimbulkan gangguan sama sekali. (coad & dunstall, 2007). sedangkan pada kehamilan jumlah sel darah putih, terutama neutrofil, meningkat dan sel lebih cepat berespon terhadap tantangan. hcg merangsang produksi dan respons neutrofil (barriga, rodriguez, & ortega, 1994). kadar progesteron dan estrogen yang tinggi menurunkan jumlah sel t helper dan meningkatkan jumlah sel penekan selama kehamilan, serum darah wanita mengandung anti-hla antibody yang dipakai untuk melawan sel limfosit dari ayah (paternal lymphocyte). sayangnya maternal hla antibody ini tidak dapat membuat anti-hla antibody terhadap sel tropoblast karena sel-sel tropoblast tidak mengeluarkan hla kelas 1 atau kelas 2 dan sering sekali maternal hla antibody munculnya terlambat pada kehamilan pertama dibandingkan pada kehamilan kedua atau ketiga. keadaan ini menimbulkan akibat di dalam klinik dengan seringnya terjadi gangguan kehamilan seperti keguguran pada primi para. (adiyono, 2004) dalam mengantisipasi keadaan tersebut maka sistem kekebalan tubuh akan menurunkan mekanisme pertahanannya melalui sistem yang disebut down regulation t-cell. sistem ini disebut juga sebagai mekanisme imun depresion yang merupakan suatu mekanisme tubuh yang menekan sistem imun atau menahan respon yang telah bangkit seperti pada hcg yang dapat menekan proses transformasi sel limfosit t. walaupun data tidak cukup untuk menentukan siapa yang berada pada resiko tinggi terhadap komplikasi penyebaran virus influenza a (h1n1), wabah flu musiman dan pandemi virus influenza yang dahulu menunjukkan bahwa wanita hamil biasanya berada pada resiko tinggi terhadap virus influenza-berhubungan dengan angka kematian dan kesakitan dibandingkan dengan wanita yang tidak hamil. (dodds, 2007) peningkatan resiko terhadap komplikasi pada wanita hamil didasarkan pada pemikiran yang berhubungan dengan perubahan secara fisiologis selama kehamilan, mencakup perubahan pada kardiovaskular, respirasi, dan sistem imun. (jamieson, 2006). dari beberapa kasus influenza a pada wanita hamil yang dilaporkan oleh center for disease control and prevention menyebutkan bahwa, sebagian besar wanita hamil memiliki gejala yang pada umumnya sama yaitu demam akut dan gejala penyakit respirasi. penelitian menunjukkan bahwa hipertermia ibu selama trimester pertama beresiko membuat cacat tabung saraf dan dapat dihubungkan dengan cacat lahir lainnya dan hasil yang merugikan. komplikasi serius akibat infeksi influenza a yang paling sering terjadi adalah penyakit yang berkenaan dengan paru-paru. banyak ibu hamil yang terus memiliki gejala khas influenza tetapi tidak membuat komplikasi. namun, bagi beberapa ibu hamil, penyakit ini mungkin berkembang secara pesat, dan mungkin terjadi komplikasi oleh infeksi bakteri sekunder termasuk pneumonia. kapasitas paru menurun karena saat rahim mengembang hal itu memindahkan diafragma (sekat rongga) ke atas dan pada dasarnya mempersempit ruang bagi paru-paru. semua perubahan ini membuat wanita hamil jadi lebih rentan dan terpengaruh lebih parah oleh virus-virus tertentu, termasuk flu. (center for disease control and prevention, 2009). sehingga wanita hamil dengan didasari kondisi kesehatan seperti asma dapat memiliki resiko tinggi terhadap komplikasi influenza. (dodds, 2007). dibandingkan dengan wanita yang tidak hamil, antara tinggi dan rendahnya resiko terhadap wanita hamil terutama selama trimester iii, memiliki lebih banyak kejadian kardiopulmonal selama musim influenza. karena pada trimester iii, perubahan fisiologis seperti perubahan kardiovaskular dan respirasi menjadi lebih berat disebabkan perkembangan janin yang semakin besar. penyebabnya dengan makin besarnya kandungan, diafragma atau sekat rongga dada pun kian tertekan ke atas. akibatnya, ruang paru-paru jadi lebih sempit, sehingga oksigen yang masuk ke paru-paru makin sedikit pula. dari hasil penelitian tim kawaoka, serangan virus h1n1 ternyata lebih berbahaya dan lebih mematikan daripada serangan virus flu biasa. virus h1n1 ternyata memiliki kemampuan menyerang kedalam sel-sel terdalam dari paru-paru, sehingga menyebabkan radang paru-paru (pneumonia) pada penderita, dan dalam beberapa kasus, faktor inilah yang kemudian menyebabkan kematian. sedangkan serangan virus flu biasa, biasanya hanya menginfeksi jaringan saluran pernapasan atas, tanpa serangan ke organ dalam paru-paru. (www.tempointeraktif.com) mekanisme terjadinya pneumonia terjadi ketika tindakan sinergi bakteri dengan virus influenza masuk mengikat dan menginvasi bakteri, meningkatkan replikasi viral, dan modifikasi dari respon inflamasi inang tersebut. interaksi antara virus influenza dan bakteri secara menyeluruh ditetapkan sebagai streptococcus pneumonia. namun selain streptococcus, patogen yang sering menginvasi pada pneumonia bakteri sekunder adalah staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenza, dan adakalanya bacil gram negatif lainnya. (schwarzmann, 2008) selain komplikasi pnumonia, ibu hamil yang terkena serangan virus influenza a dapat menyebabkan berbagai komplikasi pada si ibu maupun si janin. dari hasil penyelidikan cdc terhadap 20 kasus wanita hamil yang terserang influenza a, beberapa di antaranya mengalami komplikasi radang paru-paru, dehidrasi, dan kelahiran prematur. (schuchat, 2009) dehidrasi tersebut disebabkan karena efek influenza yang salah satunya adalah hipertermia atau demam. pada influenza a manifestasi masuknya virus ke dalam tubuh adalah timbulnya demam yang tinggi tidak seperti pada flu biasa. keadaan yang lebih berbahaya adalah bila suhu inti tubuh mencapai 40,5oc karena pada suhu tersebut otak sudah tidak dapat lagi menoleransinya. sebagai perlindungan dari heat stroke atau hilang kesadaran, untuk sementara otak dapat dipertahankan menjadi lebih dingin daripada bagian lain dari tubuh karena suhu inti yang meningkat menyebabkan pengeluaran keringat yang hebat di kepala (bahkan dengan dehidrasi), terutama pada wajah. di australia, setidaknya enam wanita hamil terpaksa melahirkan bayi mereka secara prematur karena terserang virus flu babi. mereka terpaksa melahirkan prematur sebab virus itu mengancam nyawa bayi-bayi tersebut. (sydney morning herald, 2009). hal ini dilakukan karena jika tetap mempertahankan kehamilan hingga usia yang cukup matang ditakutkan janin terinfeksi lebih parah, sehingga pilihan untuk melahirkan prematur dirasakan cukup tepat. selain itu, infeksi pada kehamilan yang disebabkan oleh virus influenza a dapat beresiko menyebakan keguguran. saat ini virus h1n1 sudah menjadi pandemi di seluruh dunia tetapi umumnya kondisi pasien yang tertular virus ini masih dalam tahap gejala ringan. namun karena wanita hamil mengalami perubahan daya tahan tubuh, wanita hamil yang tertular virus flu babi lebih cenderung mengalami gejala yang berat, bahkan juga sangat rentan menyebabkan keguguran. (center for disease control and prevention, 2009). menurut susanto (2009), ancaman terbesar dari sakit flu adalah jika terjadi demam yang tinggi pada ibu hamil. suhu tubuh yang terlalu tinggi dan terus menerus ini bisa mengakibatkan keguguran. keadaan lebih parah mengenai komplikasi virus influenza a pada ibu hamil adalah kematian. hingga 21 september 2009 sudah 3 orang wanita hamil diopname di rumah sakit karena dinyatakan tertular virus flu babi dan 2 orang diantaranya meninggal. untuk itu, sangat penting dilakukan pemeriksan dini pada ibu hamil dengan tanda dan gejala flu terhadap kemungkinan terinfeksi flu babi. (schuchat, 2009) penyakit yang bertambah parah dan kematian telah terjadi pada wanita hamil yang terkena virus influenza a ini sejak muncul pada akhir april tahun ini. enam persen dari kasus yang dilaporkan bertambah parah sampai saat ini, 1 % merupakan wanita hamil dari populasi secara umum kehamilan. (arkansas department of health and human services, 2009) selain komplikasi yang dapat terjadi pada ibu, janin juga dapat mendapatkan komplikasi dari virus influenza a ini. fetal distress dapat terjadi pada ibu dengan gejala influenza yang sudah parah. laporan kasus yang merugikan hasil kehamilan dan kematian ibu telah dikaitkan dengan penyakit berat. idealnya, ibu hamil yang telah mencurigai terkena infeksi virus influenza a (h1n1) harus dites untuk influenza. (center for disease control and prevention, 2009) selain itu, demam selama kehamilan ibu telah terbukti menjadi faktor resiko yang merugikan perkembangan bayi dan hasilnya, termasuk neonatal kejang, ensefalopati, cerebral palsy, dan kematian bayi. meskipun membedakan efek dari penyebab demam dari hipertermia itu sendiri adalah sulit, demam pada ibu hamil harus ditangani karena resiko yang muncul dari hipertermia dapat membahayakan janin. (center for disease control and prevention, 2009) penelitian telah menunjukkan bahwa hipertermia ibu selama trimester pertama menggandakan risiko cacat tabung saraf dan dapat dihubungkan dengan cacat lahir lainnya dan hasil yang merugikan. data yang terbatas menunjukkan bahwa risiko cacat lahir yang berhubungan dengan demam mungkin akan dikurangi oleh obat antipiretik dan atau multivitamin yang mengandung asam folat. (center for disease control and prevention, 2009) pengobatan ibu hamil yang suspected atau terdiagnosa dapat diberikan terapi oseltamivir 75-mg kapsul dua kali per hari selama 5 hari atau zanamivir dua 5-mg inhalasi (10 mg total) dua kali per hari selama 5 hari. obat diberikan sedini mungkin setelah timbul gejala (yaitu dalam 2 hari pertama). hal ini karena pengobatan antivirus paling efektif jika dimulai 48 jam pertama setelah timbul gejala pencegahan sebagai bidan, usaha preventif harus selalu diupayakan sebagaimana yang tercantum pada standar pelayanan bidan. pada pencegahan influenza a dapat diberikan konseling kepada ibu hamil mengenai usaha perilaku hidup sehat. ibu hamil diajarkan dan dianjurkan bagaimana cara mencuci tangan yang benar setelah atau sebelum memegang sesuatu, serta penggunaan masker untuk mencegah penyebaran virus influenza a. selain itu, ibu hamil juga perlu diberitahukan mengenai apa saja tanda dan gejala yang khas dari influenza, sehingga dapat segera memeriksakan diri sesegera mungkin jika mengalami tada dan gejala seperti itu. selain itu pencegahan dapat berupa obat antiviral oseltamivir 75-mg kapsul satu kali per hari atau zanamivir dua 5-mg inhalasi (10 mg total) satu kali per hari. obat antiviral influenza juga dapat digunakan untuk mencegah munculnya influenza bila dikonsumsi oleh mereka yang tidak sakit. tentu saja, ini diberikan untuk mereka yang berada dekat penderita influenza a. sebagai pencegahan, obat ini efektif hingga 70 – 90 %. sementara, maksimal pemberian ditentukan oleh kondisi masing-masing pribadi. (sitepoe, 2009). selain obat antiviral, pencegahan dapat dilakukan dengan pemberiaan vaksinasi. vaksinasi flu yang diberikan pada wanita hamil dapat membantu bayi untuk melawan infeksi mematikan. penelitian yang dilakukan di bangladesh itu memperoleh dukungan amerika serikat yang mengatakan wanita hamil direkomendasikan untuk diberikan vaksinasi influenza. terutama setelah dikeluarkannya larangan untuk memberikan vaksin tersebut pada bayi yang belum berusia 6 bulan. data menunjukkan satu dosis vaksin flu khusus ibu hamil dapat menyediakan keuntungan ganda untuk ibu dan bayinya. (steinhoff, 2008). wanita hamil sebaiknya mendapatkan “flu shot” suatu inactive vaksin (mengandung beberapa potongan dari virus influenza yang sudah mati). vaksin ini diberikan dengan jarum suntik, biasanya di daerah lengan. flu shot diakui dapat digunakan untuk wanita hamil. (arkansas department of health and human services, 2009). pemberian vaksin influenza pada ibu hamil biasanya dianjurkan pada ibu hamil yang umur kehamilannya sama atau lebih besar dari 14 minggu.

__label__low pages startseite ich blogge, weil ... © high five rezensionen interviews buchzitate damaris liest mini. kontakt/info montag, 7. märz 2016 review zu "mit anderen worten: ich" von tamara ireland stone magellan (januar 2016), hardcover/su, 336 seiten, übersetzt von sandra knuffinke und jessika komina, 16,95 € [d] worte sind nicht samanthas freunde. im gegenteil: in endlosen gedankenschleifen verfolgen sie sam und hindern sie daran, ein normales, unbeschwertes leben zu führen. aus angst, als verrückt abgestempelt zu werden, verheimlicht sam ihren täglichen kampf sogar vor ihren freundinnen. nur die unkonventionelle caroline sieht hinter sams fassade und lädt sie ein, sich einem geheimen dichterklub anzuschließen. hier erlebt sam zum ersten mal die befreiende kraft von worten und kommt sich seit langer zeit selbst wieder nahe. als sie sich in den klugen, zurückhaltenden aj verliebt und gerade beginnt, vorsichtig auf ihr neues glück zu vertrauen, stellt eine unerwartete entdeckung alles infrage. (text-, cover- und zitatrechte: magellan verlag) die paar lampen, die wir angeknipst haben, tauchen die wände in sanftes licht, und ich denke an all die zettel, die uns umgeben, all die liebe, den schmerz, die angst und die hoffnung. wir sind umschlossen von worten. es ist ein perfekter moment, einfach weil ich unsterblich in diesen raum und die leute darin - die echten genauso wie die an den wänden - verliebt bin. und ganz besonders in diesen einen jungen. - s. 248 meine meinung es gibt bücher, die man einfach nicht richtig greifen kann, egal wie oft man den klappentext liest, oder sich vorzustellen versucht, was es mit dem inhalt auf sich hat. "mit anderen worten: ich" ist genau so ein buch. lese ich die beschreibung jetzt, ist mir natürlich alles sonnenklar. bevor ich das buch kannte, blieben nur die begriffe worte und dichterklub bei mir hängen, und assoziierten den gedanken an poetry-slam. das trifft es aber nur fast, und so wurde ich überrascht ... wunderbar überrascht! "mit anderen worten: ich" gehört zu den leseerlebnissen, die ab der ersten seite fesseln. ich lernte samantha und ihre freundinnen kennen, die in samanthas zimmer ein schulevent vorbereiten. das erscheint harmlos, doch ein kleiner auslöser wirft samantha emotional völlig aus der bahn. man bekommt hautnah mit wie krass und zerstörerisch ihre gedanken sind. samantha hat eine zwangsstörung, gedankenspiralen werden zu panikattacken, die ihr leben bestimmt und wegen der sie seit ihrer kindheit in therapie ist. sie ist immer darauf bedacht, dass niemand von ihrer krankheit erfährt, insbesondere nicht ihre it-girl-freundinnen. mich hat das gleichzeitig erschreckt und beschäftigt, aber auch berührt. samanthas leben beginnt sich schrittweise zu verändern, als sie einem geheimen dichterklub beitritt und dort neue freunde findet. die autorin hat eine beeindruckende gabe ihre leser bei der stange zu halten. die geschichte ist hochinteressant, obwohl sie ohne vordergründige spannung auskommt. der spannungsbogen wirkt subtiler und die gefühle beim lesen gehen tief. obwohl die handlung sehr ausführlich ist, hat das buch keine länge. die ich-perspektive war hier die beste wahl und die übersetzung (ein kunststück beim thema gedichten) ist perfekt. alle charaktere, haupt- wie nebenpersonen, sind sehr echt und glaubwürdig umgesetzt. die lovestory empfand ich als genau richtig - authentisch, süß und etwas problematisch. zu einem zeitpunkt, an dem ich überhaupt nicht (mehr) mit einer wendung rechnete, hat das buch einen twist, bei dem man erst mal tief luft holen muss. so richtig wahrhaben möchte man es nicht, und ich gebe zu, ich habe hektisch an bestimmte stellen zurück geblättert. das lässt den roman nochmals in einem neuen licht erscheinen, verstärkt seine brisanz und macht das buch sehr besonders. fazit "mit anderen worten: ich" ist ein buch, von dem ich mir vor dem lesen kein umfassendes bild machen konnte, das mich dann ab der ersten seite fesselte und mit fortschreitender handlung immer mehr begeisterte. die charaktere sind sehr authentisch, die geschichte spricht ein ungewöhnliches thema an, und die gedichte sind eine exzellente ausdrucksmöglichkeit. eine völlig unerwartete wendung beleuchtet die geschichte nochmals von einer anderen seite. mit anderen worten - lesen! von mir gibt es 4,5 von 5 punkte. © damaris metzger, damarisliest.de eingestellt von damaris anna labels: review kommentare: kumosbuchwolke7. märz 2016 um 21:41liebe damariswas für eine schöne rezension zu einem ungewöhnlichen buch. ich frage mich, was so schlimm daran ist, worte im kopf zu haben?

volatility refers to the standard deviation of returns, or in simpler terms, how much returns vary around their average during a certain period of time. most people switch off at this point but they shouldn't as it is a crucially important topic, especially if one is about to retire or have investments come due on a specific date. imagine for a moment that if you had 100 percent of your wealth in the australian stock market and retired today, you would have 16 percent less than you had at the end of april. that is $160,000 less if your portfolio was worth $1 million. this equates to approximately 3-4 years of retirement income for someone at that level of wealth and is obviously significant. while many of us don't have those kind of sums on our books, this basic example shows that even the average person needs to understand volatility and how to manage it in order to achieve their financial and retirement goals. the best way to manage volatility is to have a globally diversified portfolio. that is a range of investments spread across asset classes and geographies. unfortunately, ultra-low volatility since the gfc has made people complacent and this, along with record low interest rates, has seen many people take too much risk in the stock market -- more specifically too much exposure to the australian stock market. while it's true that our market offers attractive dividends, particularly on an after-tax basis for domestic investors, most people have lost sight of the risks in the domestic market. these risks include a weaker domestic economy, a slower growing china, declining terms of trade, a sharp contraction in capital expenditure and high valuations. as a result, the attractiveness of high dividends in australia has induced people to be over-exposed to the australian stock market and hence increased the risk of not achieving their financial and retirement goals. so what can you do? people should maintain a globally diversified portfolio even if it means a lower yield. a diversified portfolio should lead to lower overall volatility and a better chance of achieving their financial goals. the reason for this is: 1) stock markets around the world are driven by different factors and 2) different asset classes, such as bonds, stocks, property, alternatives and cash, often react differently in high risk environments and hence can offset some of the overall risk. in addition to reduced risk, increased exposure to offshore stocks can make up for some of the loss in yield with potentially higher capital growth. this capital growth comes from two avenues: 1) most companies that are global leaders are listed in offshore markets and provide excellent growth potential given their dominant market positions, and 2) if the australian dollar continues to depreciate, the value of offshore holdings increases in aud terms. although the aud has already fallen 15 percent since the start of this year, there appears to be further downside given the economic outlook and sentiment surrounding china. while 60 us cents is still a long way off, the 'aussie' may find itself parked in the mid-to-late 60 cent range in the not too distant future. australians should use the recent volatility to understand that they may be taking too much risk relative to their risk profile and that they may be too concentrated in australian assets. if this is the case, this could be an opportunity to rebalance your portfolio to make it more efficient in both a risk and return sense. more:blogchina economygfcmoneyshare market more on this topic news toys r us may shut down all u.s. operations, impacting thousands of workers entertainment netflix paid 'the crown' star claire foy less than her on-screen husband news this $10,000 3d printed home could provide cheap housing for millions entertainment russell crowe is having a 'divorce auction' with lots of movie mementos news the next recession is really gonna suck politics rihanna asked australia for global education money, and got it trending 60 celebrity couples who have been together forever the ultimate vegan cheese taste test bono reveals the 'magic' that's made his 34-year marriage last ex-playboy model who claims affair with trump says he made her cry how long it takes to lose weight (and how to do it properly) reasons why you gained weight all of a sudden this artist sold $25,000 paintings when she was 9. here's what she is doing now. what 2,000 calories looks like in one day of meals how much natural sugar should we eat a day?

android ‘l’, con ‘l’ de lollipop llega la primera tarjeta recargable para compras online comparte fotos como nunca antes entre android, ios y windows phone homecómo se hace¡se mojó tu celular! ¿cómo rescatarlo? cómo se hace octubre 29, 2014 guidoray ¡se mojó tu celular! ¿cómo rescatarlo? si nunca se ha mojado tu celular, por mínimo que haya sido, probablemente es porque no lo usas diario y en todo momento. para quienes suelan soltar accidentalmente su smartphone, dejarlo olvidado a la intemperie o hayan sido arrojados a una alberca con todo y gadget en la bolsa, esta guía les ayudará a devolver la vida a su móvil. estos pasos son muy concretos y efectivos en la mayoría de los casos, pero no son garantía de que puedan resucitar al dispositivo, pues eso varía prácticamente entre cada caso, es decir, no es tan relevante que el teléfono haya estado 2 segundos o media hora bajo el agua, pues igualmente podrías lograr que vuelva a funcionar normalmente. actúa rápido lo primero que debes hacer es sacar el dispositivo del agua tan pronto como se pueda, tratando de que el mismo sea extraído con la parte donde no tenga ranuras viendo hacia arriba, de forma que el agua no ingrese aún más a través de éstas con la presión que ejerce el agua al tomar el gadget. apagar el móvil es crucial una vez afuera, debes apagar el teléfono a como dé lugar (para los dispositivos como iphone donde no se puede retirar la batería, se debe intentar apagar el móvil incluso cuando la pantalla no responda). si a tu celular sí se le puede quitar la pila, puedes hacerlo en lugar de utilizar el botón de apagado. remueve los restos de agua ya que esté apagado, usa una toalla (muy absorbente, de preferencia) y quita el exceso de agua. en este momento se deben retirar otros accesorios como tarjeta de memoria o sim. procura no soplar en los orificios puesto que el agua podría dispersarse hacia otros sitios. evita usar calor en exceso más que un paso adicional a este tutorial, esta es una recomendación. no uses secadoras para el cabello ni pongas el dispositivo a secar sobre una lámpara o cualquier otra fuente de calor, pues esto hará que el móvil se dañe interna o externamente. incluso podría derretir las partes plásticas si se deja por demasiado tiempo. tampoco debes conectar el dispositivo a la corriente en este momento, pues seguramente ocasionará un corto circuito. haz que la humedad se vaya este es el paso final antes de saber si tu smartphone se recuperó. hay por lo menos dos formas de completarlo: usa productos para absorber la humedad: en algunos establecimientos se venden productos que están hechos específicamente para retirar la humedad de algún lugar; estos saquitos – parecidos a los que algunas marcas incluyen en las cajas de sus dispositivos y que están marcados con la leyenda “silica gel” – se colocan junto al móvil dentro de una bolsa sellada (las ziploc funcionan perfecto) y se deja en un lugar seco por al menos tres días. utiliza arroz: quizá ya habías escuchado, o imaginado, que el arroz puede ser la salida en estos casos. una de las propiedades de este alimento es la de retirar la humedad, por lo que puedes tomar un recipiente con cubierta donde se pone un poco de arroz, el dispositivo y un poco más de la semilla hasta que se cubra por completo el móvil. se pone la tapa y se deja por reposar por tres días. cruza los dedos transcurridos los tres días, es la hora de la verdad. vuelve a colocar la batería dentro del smartphone y enciéndelo normalmente; puede que el teléfono no se inicie de inmediato, por lo que tendrás que intentar varias veces. también es factible que requieras conectar el gadget a la corriente para rehabilitar el sistema; en este momento esto se puede hacer puesto que la humedad debería estar completamente fuera del dispositivo. si sigues estos pasos, la probabilidad de que el móvil haya vuelto a la vida y funcione de manera normal es muy alta. sólo basta recordarlos y aplicarlos; descubrirás que los móviles que todos usan diariamente pueden ser más resistentes de lo que imaginabas. ¿alguna vez has mojado un celular por accidente?

"i was fitted when i was 16 and almost passed out when they told me i was a g-cup," melissa once said in the score models' dressing room. "i didn't know that size existed." melissa needs to buy stretchy tops. as for beshine who's gone even bigger up top, the german busen star said "i am really proud of my boobs, and i like when men look at me. sometimes they are shy and make believe they're not looking. it's okay. i think that is cute." feb 14 jenna valentine 27:18 mins. a sweater valentine there's no more-appropriate time than valentine's day to present a walking, talking valentine. this is a great scene now upgraded to hd quality. jenna valentine is a make-up artist these days. when she's at home, she says she tends to lounge around without a stitch. "i love to be naked. i will lay naked in bed, eat naked in bed and do a bunch of other stuff while i am naked in bed." "if i am going out to a club or a show, i wear super-tight corsets. i love corsets. so, corsets, short skirts...i always show cleavage. like, obviously, not if i am going to the grocery store. then i cover up. i just want to go in there, get my snacks and get out." nov 13 jenna valentine 06:45 mins. boob sorority it's a special day when scoreland models cross paths in the building. this video is a documentary of a momentous, sensational crossing of the paths. you will now witness jenna valentine, modeling at score since november of 2009, meet liza biggs, a brand-new superwoman who had never modeled before. jenna has the honors of unveiling liza's 40-inch, 36 triple-j natural marvels. she does this with great fanfare which liza richly deserves. jenna says liza's boobs are bigger. they compare breasts and areolae like graduate students in mammology. this bonus video should be cherished by die-hard breast-men. apr 5 jenna valentine 11:54 mins. miss busty coed it's easy to envision jenna valentine as a stacked coed. she looks like a college girl. no need to mentally picture that visual. it's here now in photos and a video. lugging books across a campus--what a nice image. jenna once posed as a maid during a week in mexico with leanne crow, natalie fiore, micky bells and hitomi. that was a great photo shoot and so is this. if there was a miss busty coed contest, jenna would get our votes. in 2009, when jenna first visited, a tsg editor observed that "jenna is not one of those unapproachable hotties that are too stuck-up to speak to you. to say that jenna has an amazing personality is pretty darn factual." it turns out that jenna is a fright flick fan. "i love horror movies. i like old-school universal, frankenstein, bride of frankenstein, creature from the black lagoon. i like the older '80s slasher movies like freddy krueger and jason and halloween. i have all of those on dvd. all the black 'n' white ones. i fall asleep a lot to dracula, the black 'n' white one with bela lugosi. i love the evil dead remake. a lot of new horror movies i'm not into." maybe one day we should do a halloween-style shoot with jenna. which movie or tv character would work? lily munster? morticia addams? vampirella? nov 13 jenna valentine 08:12 mins. thank god it's boobsday as "all of the feelings" (jenna_valentine) on twitter, jenna valentine has over twenty-five thousand followers. "and 16,000 on instagram," adds jenna. "although i think most of my twitter followers are weird-dick avatars that have their own twitter accounts because their picture is just a picture of a dick. where do they come from and why can't they control themselves? they're like, 'you know what would really turn a girl on? if i take a picture of my dick and use it as my twitter avatar,' and all the girls are like, 'no. i don't want it.' girls don't like that shit, so don't do that. we'll send or text each other the pictures and make fun of them. "i got a dick pic after i went on a date with a guy. it was a really nice date, and he sent me an awkward dick pic and i forwarded it to everybody and we were laughing at it. and i'll post it in this private facebook group i'm in with 3,000 girls from los angeles and we'll all laugh at your dick, so don't do that. some guy sent a picture of his boner on a beach. there was sand in most of the picture and a boner in the corner, and it said, 'just hanging at the beach,' and i said, 'first of all, why are you pulling your dick out on the beach then sending a picture to a girl?' not a good idea. nothing good came of it because i never saw him again. he ruined it. i don't want to see that after a first date. i don't even know you. i don't even know your favorite color. don't send me your dick. if he hadn't sent me that picture, we would've gone on a second date and maybe it would've gone well. we could've had sex. i could've seen his dick in person." this reminds us of a story danni ashe told us when she was modeling. in the pre-digital camera/smartphone days of the late 1990s, danni and her office staff, mostly girls, used to get polaroid instant pictures of guys' cocks in the mail. they would pin them to a large cork board and make jokes about the latest arrivals every morning. so it's really nothing new. just the tech has changed. and it's sanitary. the moral of the story? don't tweet yer meat. jan 10 jenna valentine 19:03 mins. bikini valentine at poolside, jenna valentine is killing a tiny bikini which is little more than a string with some doily-size pieces of cloth. jenna says she doesn't own bikinis because she can't find any that fit her. and she rarely goes to the beach anyway. that makes us sad. the not-fitting part is the fun part. seeing jenna overpower this bikini can overload a boob-man's little gray cells. that makes us happy. but you must love jenna for more than her huge titties and pretty face and curvaceous rack. you must also love jenna for being jenna, which is what we do. as jenna said in 2009 when she first strolled into score, "i would rather have a guy come up to me and tell me i am beautiful or even pretty than for him to tell me that i have big boobs." after a few minutes of a mixed-topic chat with the director about bikinis, dolphins, her mom's swimming pool, her breast growth spurt (now at a hh-cup) her new tattoos and dating, jenna peels off the suit and goes for a skinny dip. this is the part when the underwater footage is cut in as she wades in the pool. that frogman training was really worth the tuition fees. some sculptor somewhere should create a statue in jenna's likeness that men could pray to. we promised not to call jenna's skin "creamy" and we'll stand by that promise. but it should be okay to call jenna a work of living art. dec 20 jenna valentine 10:51 mins. advanced sweater stretching it's time to go sweater shopping with the association of sweater manufacturers' poster girl, jenna valentine. miss valentine tries on a variety of sexy sweaters, then puts on her birthday suit and gets on our glass table for a closer, loving look at her wonderfully curvy assets. what's your favorite sweater out of the ones jenna pulled over her big, 36hh boobs? jenna has gotten bustier since her previous shoots with score in mexico. "my boobs have gotten bigger, which is strange because i lost a lot of weight and i feel like they shouldn't get bigger because i've been doing this pilates/ballet-bar class every day," says jenna. "i don't know why my boobs got bigger. i don't want them to grow any more. this is good enough. when i started with voluptuous, i was a 36f. then i was a 36h." we don't know why either but we never question our good fortune. let's talk about sex. what about sex on the first date? "i like having a connection with somebody. otherwise i think sex is boring. even all of the first-date sex i've had, the guys have turned out to be boyfriends. it's like a weird instant connection we had. i think first-time sex, no matter what date it is, is really awkward because you don't know the person and you have to learn each other's bodies. i've never had first-time sex where it was the best sex ever. it's always awkward the first time getting naked in front of somebody and having sex with them." feb 14 jenna valentine 10:57 mins. lux life what better day than valentine's day for a jenna valentine appearance? jenna visits a swanky nightclub and slips out of her evening gown to show her spectacularly beautiful body. it's a "lux life" after all. jenna's very funny with a cool, wry style. she's funnier than the chicks who get their own sitcoms. thats' why jenna needs her own bravo reality tv show. she out-boobs anyone on that station. scoreland: what makes you laugh the hardest? jenna valentine: my bills. scoreland: how would you spend a million dollars? jenna valentine: i'd take a dream vacation to tokyo and surround myself with all of the hello kitties. scoreland: what's the best compliment you've ever received? jenna valentine: telling me i'm smart, cute and funny. scoreland: what's the best part of being beautiful. jenna valentine: getting presents. scoreland: what's the best way for a guy to get on your good side? jenna valentine: turn into a pizza or a kitten or a kitten with a pizza. scoreland: how are you and bras getting along these days now that your boobs are so big? jenna valentine: i've been wearing sports bras because i'm lazy and they make my boobs look better in clothes and they don't have underwires. they're so comfortable. they're stretchy and hold my boobs in better and give me better cleavage. want to try it first? sign up for a 3-day pass for only $2.99 celebrating our 25th anniversary. receive free previews & special offers! subscribe we will not spam, sell, or trade your email. home videos photos our models join now member login member services site map big boobs dvds rss feed modeling jobs affiliate program terms & conditions privacy policy 18 u.s.c. 2257 record-keeping requirements compliance statement © scoreland all rights reserved. all models depicted on this website are at least 18 years old.

__label__low bring me that horizon pirateguy's ultimate blog about info on disney, lost, tv, movies, and much, much more! view my stats wednesday, march 18, 2009 wicked: a review hello, all! i am here to give you my review of wicked, which i was able to see with my english honors class last night on broadway. alright, let’s get started!we left school a little while after it ended, around 2:45. we stop at the palisades mall for dinner. we finnaly get to the city at 6:30. we get off the bus, walk a few blocks, and get to the gershwin theater. we get seated, get snacks ($7 water bottle!?!?), but the play is delayed for about 20 minutes due to a technical error. finally, it starts.the play tells what really happened in oz. the good witch, glinda, was a snobby, preppy, spoiled girl. the wicked witch, elphaba, was discrimated becuase of her green skin, and hated by her father. one thing leads to another, and when the wizard wants elphaba's powers to hurt animals, she refuses, causing her to be considered a "wicked witch".so as for my review… i thought it was really good show. being a person who hates the wizard of oz, i didn’t know what to expect. the singing was great, and it was actually pretty funny, something i wasn’t expecting. i especially like the references to dorothy. although you never see her, you see glinda sending her down the yellow brick road, as she confesses to herself she was bad at giving directions. when the wicked witch of the east sees her sister and asks what she’s doing at her house, the wicked witch of the west replies “well, there’s no place like home”. it’s also cool how everything from the movie and the play comes together in the end, it puts a great perspective on the play. very well done, it’s become my second favorite play, right after phantom of the opera. so that’s it! after the play, we went home, go back to the school around 12:00am. i finally went to bed around 1am, and woke up at 6am to go back to school. the weird thing is that i’m not tired though. posted by pirateguy 815 at 3:35 pm reactions: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: broadway, musical, play, review, wicked no comments: post a comment newer post older post home subscribe to: post comments (atom) welcome!

a block, e.g. a macroblock abstract encoding and decoding methods that perform quantization using adaptive reconstruction levels are presented. the reconstruction levels for a given partitioning of the data space may be selected based upon the distribution of data points within each sub-part defined by the partitioning. in some cases, the adaptive reconstruction levels may be based upon an average of the data points within each sub-part. in some cases, the adaptive reconstruction levels may be selected using a rate-distortion analysis including the quantization distortion associated with the levels versus the data points and the rate associated with transmitting the encoded adaptive reconstruction levels. the methods relate to data compression in a range of applications including audio, images and video. description field [0001] the present application generally relates to data compression and, in particular, to methods and devices for using adaptive reconstruction levels in quantization and de-quantization. background [0002] data compression occurs in a number of contexts. it is very commonly used in communications and computer networking to store, transmit, and reproduce information efficiently. it finds particular application in the encoding of images, audio and video. video presents a significant challenge to data compression because of the large amount of data required for each video frame and the speed with which encoding and decoding often needs to occur. the current state-of-the-art for video encoding is the itu-t h.264/avc video coding standard. it defines a number of different profiles for different applications, including the main profile, baseline profile and others. a next-generation video encoding standard is currently under development through a joint initiative of mpeg-itu: high efficiency video coding (hevc). [0003] there are a number of standards for encoding/decoding images and videos, including h.264, that use block-based coding processes. in these processes, the image or frame is divided into blocks, typically 4×4 or 8×8, and the blocks are spectrally transformed into coefficients, quantized, and entropy encoded. in many cases, the data being transformed is not the actual pixel data, but is residual data following a prediction operation. predictions can be intra-frame, i.e. block-to-block within the frame/image, or inter-frame, i.e. between frames (also called motion prediction). it is expected that hevc will also have these features. [0004] when spectrally transforming residual data, many of these standards prescribe the use of a discrete cosine transform (dct) or some variant thereon. the resulting dct coefficients are then quantized using a quantizer that employs a uniform quantization step size, i.e. a uniform partitioning of the data space. [0005] work in lossy compression, e.g., audio/voice coding, video coding, image coding, etc., tends to focus on improving rate-distortion performance. that is, the objective of most encoding and decoding schemes is to find an optimal balance between distortion and coding rate. a rate-distortion optimization expression of the type j=d+λr is typically used, wherein the lagrangian multiplier λ represents the desired trade-off between coding rate and distortion. [0006] it would be advantageous to provide for an improved encoder, decoder and method of encoding or decoding. brief description of the drawings [0007] reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show example embodiments of the present application, and in which: [0008] fig. 1 shows, in block diagram form, an encoder for encoding video; [0009] fig. 2 shows, in block diagram form, a decoder for decoding video; [0010] fig. 3 shows an example of a partitioned data space; [0011] fig. 4 shows an example of data point distribution within a sub-part of the partitioned data space; [0012] fig. 5 shows, in flowchart form, an example method for encoding data points using quantization with adaptive reconstruction levels; [0013] fig. 6 shows, in flowchart form, an example method for encoding video data using soft-decision quantization with adaptive reconstruction levels; [0014] fig. 7 shows, in flowchart form, an example method of decoding video data that has been encoded using quantization with adaptive reconstruction levels; [0015] fig. 8 shows a simplified block diagram of an example embodiment of an encoder; and [0016] fig. 9 shows a simplified block diagram of an example embodiment of a decoder. [0017] similar reference numerals may have been used in different figures to denote similar components. description of example embodiments [0018] the present application describes methods and encoders/decoders for achieving rate-distortion improvements in lossy data compression. in some embodiments, the data compression process or devices described herein may be applied to the encoding and decoding of audio data, image data, and/or video data. in particular, the present application describes a method and process of data compression that uses adaptive reconstruction levels within a quantization operation. [0019] in one aspect, the present application describes method for encoding of a sequence of data points within a data space using a lossy data compression process. the method includes assigning a quantization index u to each data point based on a partitioning of the data space into sub-parts, wherein each sub-part is associated with one of the quantization indices u; for at least some of the sub-parts, calculating an adaptive reconstruction level qu that minimizes the joint cost of total distortion from quantization of the data points within that sub-part and the rate of transmitting the adaptive reconstruction level qu; and encoding the adaptive reconstruction levels qu and encoding the data points by their respective assigned quantization indices u, to produce encoded data. [0020] in another aspect, the present application describes method of decoding encoded compressed data, wherein the compressed data results from a lossy data compression process. the method includes entropy decoding the encoded compressed data to obtain indices u and adaptive reconstruction levels qu, wherein each index u obtained is a quantized data point from the lossy data compression process, and wherein the indices a are each associated with a respective sub-part of a data space, and wherein each adaptive reconstruction level qu specifies a reconstruction level for one of the sub-parts; and reconstructing data points as the product of each index u obtained and the adaptive reconstruction level q, associated with that index, to produce a sequence of decoded data. [0021] in a further aspect, the present application describes encoders and decoders configured to implement such methods of encoding and decoding. [0022] in yet a further aspect, the present application describes computer-readable media storing computer-executable program instructions which, when executed, configured a processor to perform the described methods of encoding and/or decoding. [0023] other aspects and features of the present application will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following description of examples in conjunction with the accompanying figures. [0024] in the description that follows, some example embodiments are described with reference to the h.264 standard for video coding. those ordinarily skilled in the art will understand that the present application is not limited to h.264 but may be applicable to other video coding/decoding standards, including possible future standards, such as hevc. it will also be appreciated that the present application is not necessarily limited to video coding/decoding and may be applicable to audio coding/decoding, image coding/decoding, or the lossy coding/decoding of any other data. the present application is broadly applicable to any lossy data compression process that employs quantization irrespective of the type of data being coded/decoded. [0025] in the description that follows, when referring to video or images the terms frame and slice may be used somewhat interchangeably. those of skill in the art will appreciate that, in the case of the h.264 standard, a frame may contain one or more slices. it will also be appreciated that certain encoding/decoding operations are performed on a frame-by-frame basis and some are performed on a slice-by-slice basis, depending on the particular requirements of the applicable image or video coding standard. in any particular embodiment, the applicable image or video coding standard may determine whether the operations described below are performed in connection with frames and/or slices, as the case may be. accordingly, those ordinarily skilled in the art will understand, in light of the present disclosure, whether particular operations or processes described herein and particular references to frames, slices, or both are applicable to frames, slices, or both for a given embodiment. [0026] in the discussion that follows, reference is made to dct coefficients and the dct domain; however, it will be appreciated that this application is not limited the encoding of dct coefficients, the encoding of block-based transform coefficients, the encoding of block-based data, or any particular data type. to the extent that the processes or methods described below are applied to images and/or video they may be applied on a block-basis, a slice-basis, a frame-basis, a group-of-pictures (gop) basis, or otherwise, as will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art after a full review of the following description. to the extent that the process or methods described herein are applied to audio, such as music or voice data, they may be applied to a grouping or sequence of data points, e.g. an audio sample. [0027] reference is now made to fig. 1, which shows, in block diagram form, an encoder 10 for encoding video. reference is also made to fig. 2, which shows a block diagram of a decoder 50 for decoding video. it will be appreciated that the encoder 10 and decoder 50 described herein may each be implemented on an application-specific or general purpose computing device, containing one or more processing elements and memory. the operations performed by the encoder 10 or decoder 50, as the case may be, may be implemented by way of application-specific integrated circuit, for example, or by way of stored program instructions executable by a general purpose processor. the device may include additional software, including, for example, an operating system for controlling basic device functions. the range of devices and platforms within which the encoder 10 or decoder 50 may be implemented will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art having regard to the following description. [0028] the encoder 10 receives a video source 12 and produces an encoded bitstream 14. the decoder 50 receives the encoded bitstream 14 and outputs a decoded video frame 16. the encoder 10 and decoder 50 may be configured to operate in conformance with a number of video compression standards. for example, the encoder 10 and decoder 50 may be h.264/avc compliant. in other embodiments, the encoder 10 and decoder 50 may conform to other video compression standards, including evolutions of the h.264/avc standard. [0029] the encoder 10 includes a spatial predictor 21, a coding mode selector 20, transform processor 22, quantizer 24, and entropy encoder 26. as will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art, the coding mode selector 20 determines the appropriate coding mode for the video source, for example whether the subject frame/slice is of i, p, or b type, and whether particular macroblocks within the frame/slice are inter or intra coded. the transform processor 22 performs a transform upon the spatial domain data. in particular, the transform processor 22 applies a block-based transform to convert spatial domain data to spectral components. for example, in many embodiments a discrete cosine transform (dct) is used. other transforms, such as a discrete sine transform or others may be used in some instances. the block-based transform is performed on a macroblock or sub-block basis, depending on the size of the macroblocks. in the h.264 standard, for example, a typical 16×16 macroblock contains sixteen 4×4 transform blocks and the dct process is performed on the 4×4 blocks. in some cases, the transform blocks may be 8×8, meaning there are four transform blocks per macroblock. in yet other cases, the transform blocks may be other sizes. in some cases, a 16×16 macroblock may include a non-overlapping combination of 4×4 and 8×8 transform blocks. [0030] applying the block-based transform to a block of pixel data results in a set of transform domain coefficients. a “set” in this context is an ordered set in which the coefficients have coefficient positions. in some instances the set of transform domain coefficients may be considered a “block” or matrix of coefficients. in the description herein the phrases a “set of transform domain coefficients” or a “block of transform domain coefficients” are used interchangeably and are meant to indicate an ordered set of transform domain coefficients. [0031] the set of transform domain coefficients is quantized by the quantizer 24. the quantized coefficients and associated information are then encoded by the entropy encoder 26. [0032] intra-coded frames/slices (i.e. type i) are encoded without reference to other frames/slices. in other words, they do not employ temporal prediction. however intra-coded frames do rely upon spatial prediction within the frame/slice, as illustrated in fig. 1 by the spatial predictor 21. that is, when encoding a particular block the data in the block may be compared to the data of nearby pixels within blocks already encoded for that frame/slice. using a prediction algorithm, the source data of the block may be converted to residual data. the transform processor 22 then encodes the residual data. h.264, for example, prescribes nine spatial prediction modes for 4×4 transform blocks. in some embodiments, each of the nine modes may be used to independently process a block, and then rate-distortion optimization is used to select the best mode. [0033] the h.264 standard also prescribes the use of motion prediction/compensation to take advantage of temporal prediction. accordingly, the encoder 10 has a feedback loop that includes a de-quantizer 28, inverse transform processor 30, and deblocking processor 32. these elements mirror the decoding process implemented by the decoder 50 to reproduce the frame/slice. a frame store 34 is used to store the reproduced frames. in this manner, the motion prediction is based on what will be the reconstructed frames at the decoder 50 and not on the original frames, which may differ from the reconstructed frames due to the lossy compression involved in encoding/decoding. a motion predictor 36 uses the frames/slices stored in the frame store 34 as source frames/slices for comparison to a current frame for the purpose of identifying similar blocks. accordingly, for macroblocks to which motion prediction is applied, the “source data” which the transform processor 22 encodes is the residual data that comes out of the motion prediction process. for example, it may include information regarding the reference frame, a spatial displacement or “motion vector”, and residual pixel data that represents the differences (if any) between the reference block and the current block. information regarding the reference frame and/or motion vector may not be processed by the transform processor 22 and/or quantizer 24, but instead may be supplied to the entropy encoder 26 for encoding as part of the bitstream along with the quantized coefficients. [0034] those ordinarily skilled in the art will appreciate the details and possible variations for implementing h.264 encoders. [0035] the decoder 50 includes an entropy decoder 52, dequantizer 54, inverse transform processor 56, spatial compensator 57, and deblocking processor 60. a frame buffer 58 supplies reconstructed frames for use by a motion compensator 62 in applying motion compensation. the spatial compensator 57 represents the operation of recovering the video data for a particular intra-coded block from a previously decoded block. [0036] the bitstream 14 is received and decoded by the entropy decoder 52 to recover the quantized coefficients. side information may also be recovered during the entropy decoding process, some of which may be supplied to the motion compensation loop for use in motion compensation, if applicable. for example, the entropy decoder 52 may recover motion vectors and/or reference frame information for inter-coded macroblocks. [0037] the quantized coefficients are then dequantized by the dequantizer 54 to produce the transform domain coefficients, which are then subjected to an inverse transform by the inverse transform processor 56 to recreate the “video data”. it will be appreciated that, in some cases, such as with an intra-coded macroblock, the recreated “video data” is the residual data for use in spatial compensation relative to a previously decoded block within the frame. the spatial compensator 57 generates the video data from the residual data and pixel data from a previously decoded block. in other cases, such as inter-coded macroblocks, the recreated “video data” from the inverse transform processor 56 is the residual data for use in motion compensation relative to a reference block from a different frame. both spatial and motion compensation may be referred to herein as “prediction operations”. [0038] the motion compensator 62 locates a reference block within the frame buffer 58 specified for a particular inter-coded macroblock. it does so based on the reference frame information and motion vector specified for the inter-coded macroblock. it then supplies the reference block pixel data for combination with the residual data to arrive at the recreated video data for that macroblock. [0039] a deblocking process may then be applied to a reconstructed frame/slice, as indicated by the deblocking processor 60. after deblocking, the frame/slice is output as the decoded video frame 16, for example for display on a display device. it will be understood that the video playback machine, such as a computer, set-top box, dvd or blu-ray player, and/or mobile handheld device, may buffer decoded frames in a memory prior to display on an output device. [0040] it is expected that hevc-compliant encoders and decoders will have many of these same features. quantization [0041] for a given block of pixels x with a prediction p, the residual is z=x−p. in this example, the block of pixels x and residual z are the same size as the transform matrix t. the residual z is transformed (for example by using a dct) to generate the set of transform domain coefficients c. the coefficients c are quantized using a selected quantization step size to produce a set of quantized coefficients u. this may be expressed as: [0000] u=round(c/q+δ) (1) [0042] where an input c is quantized to a by applying a quantization step size q, and 1>δ>0 is an offset. because the quantization output is calculated by a deterministic function, this is also called hard-decision quantization. [0043] the quantization operation can be viewed from a rate-distortion point-of-view. in fact, the quantization operation can be refined so as to select indices u such that the selected indices result in a minimum rate-distortion cost. the minimum rate-distortion cost may be expressed as follows: [0000] min u   c - u · q  2 + λ · r  ( u ) ( 2 ) [0044] in equation (2), c is the matrix of transform coefficients, q is the quantization step size, and u is the corresponding matrix of indices to which the coefficients have been quantized. the symbol • stands for element-wise multiplication between matrixes. λ is the lagrangian multiplier, a constant that is determined by end users based on their preference of the coding rate and the video quality. a relatively small λ puts more preference on better quality, while a larger λ emphasizes on a lower coding rate. r(u) represents the rate function by entropy coding for the indices u, and r(u) represents the rate function for encoding and transmitting u. the entropy coding may be any suitable or applicable entropy coding scheme. in the case of jpeg images, for example, the coding may be huffman coding. in the case of h.264 video, the coding may be cavlc or cabac coding. yet other context-dependent or context-independent coding schemes may be applicable in particular embodiments. clearly, the quantization output from equation (2) is not given by a deterministic function anymore, but is the output of an optimization process that relates to both the rate and the distortion. thus, it is named soft-decision quantization. [0045] example embodiments of soft-decision quantization are described in us patent publication no. 2007/0217506 filed by yang et al. (hereinafter “yang”). the yang publication describes the optimization of a given a fixed q. this is termed “soft-decision quantization”, since the transform domain coefficients themselves are treated as free-parameters in the rate-distortion optimization. the application of soft-decision quantization to h.264 encoding using cavlc is described in yang, and it may include the use of a trellis to search for a set of quantized coefficients u that result in a minimum cumulative rate-distortion for a given entropy encoding scheme. in the example described in yang, the h.264 cavlc encoding scheme was used for illustration. [0046] in h.264 and in many other coding schemes the quantization step sizes are predetermined, and in a particular instance the encoder selects one of the quantization step sizes to use for quantizing a particular set of data points, whether a block, slice, frame, etc. the encoder then only needs to transmit an index or indicator so as to inform the decoder which quantization step size was used. [0047] reference is now made to fig. 3, which graphically illustrates a portion of a data space 100. in this example, the data space 100 contains the set of data points to be quantized using a selected quantization scheme. conceptually, in order to perform quantization, the data space 100 may be considered to be partitioned into sub-parts a0, a1, . . . an, where n+1 is the number of sub-parts. each sub-part may be referenced by its index u, where u=0, 1, . . . , n. a data point falling within one of the sub-parts ai is quantized to index u=i. reconstruction levels qu are at the midpoint of their respective sub-parts. when the decoder reconstructs a data point, it reconstructs it as reconstruction level qu; in the case of u=i the data point is reconstructed as qi irrespective of where within the sub-part ai the actual data point was located. if the source data is uniform, then the assumption of a midpoint reconstruction level will result in minimal distortion; however the assumption of a uniform distribution of source data may be inaccurate in many cases. [0048] reference is now made to fig. 4, which shows an example sub-part ai. the midpoint reconstruction level is shown as qi. the non-uniform distribution of the source data points is shown as reference numeral 102. it will be appreciated that data points with a distribution as shown by 102 would be better represented by an adaptive reconstruction level at or near qi′. the adaptive reconstruction level may be based upon the actual distribution of data points that are associated with or assigned the index i, i.e. that are located within the sub-part ai. the adaptive reconstruction level may be based upon the arithmetic mean or median or mode, in some embodiments. by adjusting the reconstruction level to reflect the distribution of the actual data points within a sub-part ai, the presently described process compensates for some of the distortion attributable to the non-uniform distribution of the data points when relying upon an assumption of uniformity. [0049] in many data compression processes, when quantization is performed the partitioning of the data space and selection of the reconstruction levels are not considered separately. for example, in itu-t h.264/avc, both are subsumed under the selection of a quantization step size. the present applicants have recognized that the partitioning of the data space and the selection of a reconstruction level for each sub-part may be considered separately, and need not be based upon a pre-determined reconstruction level, for example at the midpoint of the sub-part as in itu-t h.264/avc. [0050] thus, the quantization under this process becomes a two-stage operation. first, the data points are assigned to a quantization index (i.e. based on the partitioning of the data space, the data points are grouped into sub-parts). the partitioning/quantization at this first stage may be uniform, non-uniform, predetermined hard-decision quantization, or soft-decision quantization. the step size/partition size may be selected from amongst a preset number of candidate step sizes/partition sizes based on a rate-distortion optimization process. in all these possible variations, the data points are each assigned one of the indices for the selected quantization partition structure. [0051] second, the adaptive reconstruction level for each sub-part of the partitioned data space (e.g. each index) is determined. the adaptive reconstruction level may be based upon an averaging of actual data points falling within the sub-part. the averaging may occur over a block, group of blocks, slice, frame, group-of-pictures (gop) or other suitable collection of data points given the specific application. [0052] the selection of the adaptive reconstruction level for each index may be based upon a rate-distortion analysis. in other words, it may be based upon selecting a reconstruction level that minimizes the total distortion given the actual data points within the sub-part. it may further be based upon minimizing a cost function including distortion from the difference between the reconstruction level and the actual data points and the rate cost associated with transmitting the reconstruction level. the rate cost associated with transmitting the reconstruction level may be based upon the encoding scheme used to entropy encode the reconstruction levels. [0053] reference is now made to fig. 5, which shows, in flowchart form, a method 200 of quantizing data. the method 200 is for quantizing and encoding a plurality data points. the data points fall within a data space that may be considered to be partitioned into a set of sub-parts for the purpose of the quantization. each of the sub-parts has an associated quantization index. [0054] in operation 202, a quantization index is assigned to each of the data points. in other words, each data point falling within a sub-part is assigned the quantization index of that sub-part. the quantization that occurs in operation 202 may be hard-decision quantization or soft-decision quantization. the partitioning of the data space may be uniform or non-uniform. [0055] once the data points have been quantized in operation 202, i.e. have each been assigned a quantization index, then in operation 204 an adaptive reconstruction level is calculated for each quantization index. the adaptive reconstruction level of a given index is calculated based on minimizing the joint cost of the total distortion from quantizing the data points within that sub-part and the rate of transmitting the adaptive reconstruction level. a lagrangian rate-distortion cost expression may be used to determine the minimum cost and select the corresponding adaptive reconstruction level. [0056] once the adaptive reconstruction level for each index has been calculated in operation 204, then in operation 206 the adaptive reconstruction levels and the data points are entropy encoded. it will be understood that the data points themselves are not encoded, but rather the quantization indices that have been assigned to them by the quantization of operation 202. any suitable entropy encoding process or scheme may be used to encode the reconstruction levels. selection of a suitable entropy encoding method, including selection of no encoding, is within the skill of an ordinary person familiar with the art. [0057] in one example embodiment, given the quantization indices un for a group of blocks cn, the adaptive reconstruction levels are calculated to minimize a joint cost of the total distortion and the extra rate for transmitting the reconstruction levels. for each quantization index u, let cu,1, cu,2, . . . , cu,m denote the input source symbols (for example, dct coefficients in h.264 before quantization) which are quantized to u, where m is an integer depending upon u. then we find qu such that q, minimizes [0000] (c u,1 −u·q u)2+(c u,2 −u·q u)2+ . . . +(cu,m −u·q u)2 +λ·r(q u) (3) [0058] where r(qu) denotes the length function of a prefix code for qu according to the selected entropy encoding scheme. [0059] reference is now made to fig. 6, which shows, in flowchart form, an example method 300 of encoding video data. this example method 300 illustrates the specific application of the quantization process described above in the context of video encoding. the method 300 may be implemented in a video encoder using hardware, software, or a combination thereof. [0060] in operation 302 blocks of transform domain coefficients c are obtained. it will be appreciated that there are many preceding steps, including performing motion or spatial prediction and obtaining residual values, with or without rate-distortion optimization. the transform domain coefficients c are obtained through spectral transform of the residual data, in some instances using a dct operation. in many instances, the transform is performed on a block-by-block basis. the h.264 standard, for example, prescribes a dct operation performed on 4×4 or 8×8 blocks of residual data. the resulting set of transform domain coefficients c include 16 or 64 data points, as the case may be. it will be appreciated that some of the operations described herein may also be performed on a block-by-block basis. however, in many cases the method 300 of determining adaptive reconstruction levels may be performed for groups of blocks at a time, such as a slice, frame, gop, or other grouping of blocks of data. [0061] in operation 304, given a set of reconstruction levels qu for a partitioning with indices u, soft decision quantization is performed to quantize the transform domain coefficients c, i.e. to assign an index u for each transform domain coefficient c. the soft decision quantization may include selecting indices a that minimize a total rate-distortion cost. equation (2) above is an example expression that may be used to find indices resulting in a minimum total rate-distortion cost. the initial set of reconstruction levels qu may be those reconstruction levels associated with the current quantization step size, as prescribed by the applicable encoding standard. [0062] out of operation 304, the transform domain coefficients c are each quantized and represented by an assigned index u. in operation 306, those assigned indices u are fixed and adaptive reconstruction levels qu are found that minimize a rate-distortion cost, such as that given by equation (3) above. after operation 306, each index a has an updated reconstruction level (referred to herein as an adaptive reconstruction level) qu. [0063] the process may be iterative. that is, operations 304 and 306 may be repeated by fixing the reconstruction levels in operation 304 to find indices that minimize the cost expression of equation (2) and then fixing the indices in operation 306 to find the reconstruction levels that minimize the cost expression of equation (3), repeatedly. operation 308 may include an evaluation of whether to stop the iterative loop of operations 304 and 306. in this example operation 308 determines whether the adaptive reconstruction levels qu have changed by more than a threshold amount δ. if so, then operations 304 and 306 are repeated. if not, then the method 300 moves to operation 310, where the video is entropy encoded. this operation 310 includes entropy encoding the indices u and the adaptive reconstruction levels qu. [0064] decoding of an encoded video is now illustrated by way of the example method 400 shown in fig. 7. the example method 400 is preceded by obtaining or receiving the encoded video data, for example over a computer network, a broadcast network, or from a digital recording device such as a dvd or other computer-readable medium. in operation 402 the bitstream of encoded video data is entropy decoded to obtain the indices u and the adaptive reconstruction levels qu. in operation 404, the transform domain coefficients are reconstructed as u·qu. the reconstructed transform domain coefficients are then inverse transformed in operation 406, and suitable spatial or motion compensation is applied, as the case may be, in operation 408. in operation 410 the video is output, for example to a display screen or through a video output port. [0065] it will be appreciated that in some embodiments, an adaptive reconstruction level qu may not be encoded and transmitted for every sub-part. some sub-parts may have too few data points to justify sending an adaptive reconstruction level qu from a rate-distortion point of view. in other cases, some sub-parts may have a data point distribution with a median that does not deviate significantly from the midpoint of the sub-part, meaning that the adaptive reconstruction level qu is nearly identical to the midpoint and the distortion gain does not outweigh the rate cost associated with sending the adaptive reconstruction level qu. [0066] in one embodiment, the encoder and decoder may be configured such that the encoder calculates and transmits adaptive reconstruction levels qu for lower indices. as soon as the encoder encounters an index in which the adaptive reconstruction level qu should not be sent, due to a rate-distortion analysis, then the encoder ceases to calculate adaptive reconstruction levels for higher indices and inserts a stop code in the encoding of the adaptive reconstruction levels qu to indicate to the decoder that no further levels will be sent for higher indices. other methods or operations for determining which adaptive reconstruction levels to send may be used. [0067] in a case study of residual coding for video compression, a simple scheme of signaling adaptive reconstruction levels for only a few selected sub-parts as the corresponding average of data points within those sub-parts has proved to improve the rate distortion performance significantly. [0068] in one possible embodiment, a finite set of quantizers with various reconstruction levels may be constructed or preconfigured. in the encoding process, the encoder may dynamically select one quantizer from the set of quantizers on the basis that it realizes the best rate-distortion performance, i.e. lowest cost, among the candidate quantizers of the set. the choice of quantizer is then communicated to the decoder in the output bitstream. [0069] reference is now made to fig. 8, which shows a simplified block diagram of an example embodiment of an encoder 900. the encoder 900 includes a processor 902, memory 904, and an encoding application 906. the encoding application 906 may include a computer program or application stored in memory 904 and containing instructions for configuring the processor 902 to perform steps or operations such as those described herein. for example, the encoding application 906 may encode and output bitstreams encoded in accordance with the adaptive reconstruction level quantization process described herein. the input data points may relate to audio, images, video, or other data that may be subject of a lossy data compression scheme. the encoding application 906 may include a quantization module 908 configured to determine an adaptive reconstruction level for each index of a partition structure. the encoding application 906 may include an entropy encoder 26 configured to entropy encode the adaptive reconstruction levels qu and other data. it will be understood that the encoding application 906 may be stored in on a computer readable medium, such as a compact disc, flash memory device, random access memory, hard drive, etc. [0070] reference is now also made to fig. 9, which shows a simplified block diagram of an example embodiment of a decoder 1000. the decoder 1000 includes a processor 1002, a memory 1004, and a decoding application 1006. the decoding application 1006 may include a computer program or application stored in memory 1004 and containing instructions for configuring the processor 1002 to perform steps or operations such as those described herein. the decoding application 1006 may include an entropy decoder 1008 and a de-quantization module 1010 configured to obtain adaptive reconstruction levels qu and use them to reconstruct transform domain coefficients or other such data points. it will be understood that the decoding application 1006 may be stored in on a computer readable medium, such as a compact disc, flash memory device, random access memory, hard drive, etc. [0071] it will be appreciated that the decoder and/or encoder according to the present application may be implemented in a number of computing devices, including, without limitation, servers, suitably programmed general purpose computers, audio/video encoding and playback devices, set-top television boxes, television broadcast equipment, and mobile devices. the decoder or encoder may be implemented by way of software containing instructions for configuring a processor to carry out the functions described herein. the software instructions may be stored on any suitable computer-readable memory, including cds, ram, rom, flash memory, etc. [0072] it will be understood that the encoder described herein and the module, routine, process, thread, or other software component implementing the described method/process for configuring the encoder may be realized using standard computer programming techniques and languages. the present application is not limited to particular processors, computer languages, computer programming conventions, data structures, other such implementation details. those skilled in the art will recognize that the described processes may be implemented as a part of computer-executable code stored in volatile or non-volatile memory, as part of an application-specific integrated chip (asic), etc. [0073] certain adaptations and modifications of the described embodiments can be made.

jaar een aantal zaden gekregen van deze soort. ik ben er zeer tevreden over qua smaak en qua opbrengst. het is een echte franse heirloom cantaloupe, dat wil zeggen een oud ras dat nog bewaard wordt in kleinere kringen, dus niet zo gemakkelijk te vinden. deze meloen heeft zoete oranje vruchtvlees en weegt ongeveer 500 gram tot 1 kg. ze heeft 85-90 dagen nodig om volle opbrengst te bekomen. delice de

__label__low opinion media bullshit alerts about us contact home▶commentary▶when gods collide when gods collide peter bolland december 9th, 2017 our more adamant christian friends defensively remind us that “jesus is the reason for the season.” then they load their kids up in the suv and take them to the mall to see santa. “it’s tradition,” they say. it certainly is. in religious studies there’s a word for this. it’s called henotheism. you’ve heard of polytheism. that’s the belief in many gods. and you’ve certainly heard of monotheism. that’s the belief in only one god. so what’s henotheism? henotheism is a pretty subtle middle ground between polytheism and monotheism. in fact, some scholars argue that henotheism was an intermediate stage the ancient hebrews moved through around the time of abraham (c. 1,800 b.c.e.) as polytheism evolved into monotheism in western religion. henotheism is the claim that while there may be many gods, one god is the principal god who rules over all of them, and is in some way their source. hinduism is a classic example. while in devotional hinduism there are literally thousands of gods, even the most illiterate villager knows that they are merely the many names and forms of the one, brahmam, which isn’t even a god. it’s the sacred formless source from which all forms (including the gods) come and to which the return – the very ground of being itself. so too in the dominant christianized west, while nominally monotheistic, henotheism holds sway. santa claus, an archetypal gift-giving god, is sidled up alongside the baby jesus, and in images like this one, portrayed as bowing down in deference to the one, true god. henotheism strikes me as a very sensible compromise. it’s such a bore when zealots weigh in proclaiming their particular god to be the only god, and all other gods are false and must be destroyed. yawn. go away. sell it somewhere else sister. you could say that once christians allowed the concept of the trinity to stand, they opened the door to a pluralistic portrait of god. judaism and islam, their abrahamic siblings, cleave close to a fierce and unambiguous monotheism. but the moment the one god refracted into three — father, son, and holy spirit – like white light through a prism, the road to henotheism was paved. if you can embrace, or even tolerate the idea that the one shows up as three, the cat’s out of the bag. and it’s not going back in. so celebrate your family traditions and mythologies in full voice and without apology. you don’t have to defend or explain any of it to anyone. just go ahead and enjoy yourself. but leave your neighbors alone to do the same. religion peter bolland peter bolland is the philosophy and humanities department chair at southwestern college in chula vista, california where he teaches world religions, asian philosophy, world mythology, and ethics. bolland is also a columnist for both unity magazine and the san diego troubadour. an award winning singer-songwriter and poet, bolland draws on the world’s wisdom traditions as a frequent lecturer and performer throughout the san diego region. see more from peter bolland recent commentary sanctuary cities saving lives hillary; time for you to go ice makes everything more dangerous in defense of being liberal nra’s winner take all contributors brian karem chip franklin chris flint john lannister jon austin maureen donohue mike larsen nikki medoro nozmo king peter bolland opinion media bullshit alerts about us contact privacy policy|terms of use copyright © 2018 inside the beltway all rights reserved. inside the beltway opinionmediabullshit alertsabout uscontact

__label__low skip to main | skip to sidebar gapplegate music review the blog covers releases in the areas of free and mainstream jazz, world music, "art" rock, and the blues. classical coverage, which was originally here, continues on the gapplegate classical-modern review (see link on this page). where are we right now and how did we get here? that's the concern. wednesday, september 26, 2012 sylvain guerineau, didier lasserre, jean rougier, ligne sylvain guerineau (tenor), didier lasserre (drums) and jean rougier (bass) have done something on their album ligne (improvising beings ib12) that isn't done too much these days: make a free-avant jazz album in a ballad mode. of course paul bley did some masterful examples long ago, and ayler and shepp could be devastating in this mode, but lately there hasn't been that much, has there? and of course the bare fact that these three players have done it wouldn't matter if they didn't come through with some invigorating improvisations. but they do. the three are not well-known in the states. perhaps this will help. sylvain guerineau is much the star of this session. he has ideas, a lithe, slinky approach and a rich tone that goes well with the music. lasserre and rougier add much in the three-way dialog that continues throughout. but sylvain stands out as the lead voice most of the time. it's an album you might not expect coming out on the improvising beings label. but then the label is showing itself to take a refreshing "why not?" stance on what releases i've heard of theirs so far. so unexpected is not completely unexpected. this is very listenable, very enjoyable trio music. check it out. posted by grego applegate edwards at 7:17 am labels: avant jazz from europe, free-avant ballads, free-avant jazz, sylvain guerineau's ligne gapplegate music review no comments: post a comment newer post older post home subscribe to: post comments (atom) other gapplegate music blogs gapplegate classical-modern review gapplegate guitar and bass blog blog archive ► 2018 (2) ► january (2) ► 2017 (108) ► december (3) ► november (5) ► october (7) ► september (11) ► august (10) ► july (10) ► june (9) ► may (13) ► april (7) ► march (14) ► february (11) ► january (8) ► 2016 (195) ► december (11) ► november (9) ► october (14) ► september (14) ► august (17) ► july (13) ► june (18) ► may (20) ► april (19) ► march (24) ► february (18) ► january (18) ► 2015 (236) ► december (22) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (17) ► august (19) ► july (20) ► june (19) ► may (19) ► april (22) ► march (17) ► february (21) ► january (20) ► 2014 (239) ► december (21) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (21) ► july (20) ► june (20) ► may (19) ► april (19) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (21) ► 2013 (275) ► december (19) ► november (17) ► october (18) ► september (20) ► august (27) ► july (23) ► june (15) ► may (24) ► april (31) ► march (26) ► february (34) ► january (21) ▼ 2012 (223) ► december (14) ► november (15) ► october (17) ▼ september (17) donato bourassa lozano tanguay, autour de bill eva... sylvain guerineau, didier lasserre, jean rougier, ... richard sussman quintet, continuum construction party, instruments of change aram shelton quartet, everything for somebody mario rechtern, eric zinman, zorn arts & sciences, new you zusaan kali fasteau (kali. z. fasteau), worlds bey... chemical clock ep jeff shurdut, gene janas, marc edwards, bound and ... jimmy mulidore and his new york city jazz band, fe... sumi tonooka, now, live at the howland cultural ce... virginia mayhew quartet, mary lou williams--the ne... jonah parzen-johnson, michiana szilard mezei szabad quintet, singing elephant bad luck, two, 2011 sonny simmons, delphine latil, symphony of the pea... ► august (19) ► july (21) ► june (20) ► may (18) ► april (19) ► march (19) ► february (22) ► january (22) ► 2011 (223) ► december (21) ► november (22) ► october (12) ► september (14) ► august (19) ► july (10) ► june (17) ► may (21) ► april (21) ► march (24) ► february (21) ► january (21) ► 2010 (261) ► december (22) ► november (23) ► october (19) ► september (23) ► august (22) ► july (23) ► june (22) ► may (22) ► april (23) ► march (23) ► february (20) ► january (19) ► 2009 (146) ► december (21) ► november (20) ► october (23) ► september (21) ► august (16) ► july (18) ► june (16) ► may (10) ► january (1) about me grego applegate edwards cape may, new jersey, united states i am a life-long writer, musician, composer and editor. i wrote for cadence for many years, a periodical covering jazz and improv music. my combined blogspot blogs (as listed in the links) now cover well over 3,000 recordings in review. it's been a labor of love. the music is chosen because i like it, for the most part, so you won't find a great deal of nastiness here. i have no affiliations and gain nothing from liking what i do, so that makes me somewhat impartial. i do happen to like a set of certain musics done well, so it's not everything released that gets coverage on these blogs. i have thirteen volumes of compositions available on amazon.com. just type in "grego applegate edwards" to find them. (but one is under "gregory applegate edwards.") i went to music and higher education schools and got degrees. it changed my life and gave me the ability to think and write better. i've studied with master musicians, too. the benefits i gained from them are invaluable. i appreciate my readers. you are why i write these reviews. i hope the joy of music enriches your life like it does mine. thank you. and thank you to all the artists that make it possible. view my complete profile all content copyright 2009-18 grego applegate edwards. he is an independent writer with no ties to any organization or company. links of interest ayler records blog catalog site cimp records clean feed records esp disk naxos records pfr porto franco records tzadik records followers

advertising cars and trucks* posted on september 18, 2014 *this is a false statement and would violate advertising law by: terrence j. o'loughlin there is simply no way a short column could address every issue. however, advertising isn’t that complex and conscientious dealers can certainly understand the basics and apply them. i would never discourage dealers from using their attorneys or advertising firms for assistance in these matters. but, understanding advertising basics will help dealers converse with their attorneys and third parties about effective and legally competent advertisements. regardless of whom a dealer utilizes for advertising advice, ultimately, the dealer bears the risk and liability for the advertisement. what is an advertisement? simply stated, it is notice given in a manner designed to attract public attention. it is information communicated to the public, or to an individual concerned, as by handbills, newspapers, signs, bill boards, sound trucks, radio, websites, internet applications, television, telephone, fax, mail, prices posted on windshields, social media, or any other imaginable media. advertising can be powerful as the old saying illustrates: “there are twenty-five peaks higher than pikes peak in colorado. name one.” why should dealers be motivated to examine their advertising? dealers should be motivated to reevaluate their advertising protocols. there has been a recent spate of advertising cases by state attorneys general and the federal trade commission (ftc) in the past several years. for example, the ftc’s “operation steer clear” took action against dealers in california, georgia, illinois, massachusetts, michigan, north carolina, and texas. state attorneys general have also pursued advertising cases against dealers and assessed substantial fines in these states: arizona ($195,000), missouri ($540,000), massachusetts ($225,000), new york ($800,000), vermont ($16,000) and washington ($55,000). what these cases all have in common is the violation of the basic consumer protection law: the unfair and deceptive trade practices act, fondly called udap (i.e., the ftc act or, in the states, the little ftc act). basic advertising test the basic test, as applied to advertising, is: does the advertising have the tendency or capacity to mislead the consumer? that consumer would be a person of reasonable intelligence and perception. once upon a time, it was the “reasonable man” standard, but in this politically correct and gender-neutral era, it is now the “reasonable person” standard. my personal advertising operations and experiences in the many years b.i., (before internet), on monday mornings, at just about every state attorney general’s office, (this columnist worked at the florida ag’s office) regulators would peruse the advertising sections of the sunday papers identifying dealer advertisement violations. these cases were easy to make and padded regulators’ performance statistics. one of the criteria for success in an attorney general’s office is how much money a regulator brings in. as the udap statute allows for handsome statutory penalties a quick advertising case, in many states, could bring in between $10,000 to $25,000 per cited advertisement. this practice continues to this day, however, now all forms of media are being reviewed. i was never enamored by advertising cases. most of the consumers i spoke with didn’t trust dealer ads. my favorite undercover advertising case was visiting a dealer, who had published an ad for a cressida several thousand dollars below invoice. it was not possible to sell that vehicle for that price. when i visited the store the salesman showed me the various cressidas for sale and their sticker prices were all ten thousand dollars above this advertised price. when i showed him the advertisement, he responded to it, without hesitation, and said, “we couldn’t possibly sell this car for that price. we publish these ads just to get people to come in.” i also received complaints from various dealers, who remained anonymous, and would send disreputable advertisements to me for attorney general action. i would recommend that all honest dealers do the same as a form of self-policing. honest dealers shouldn’t be disadvantaged for following the law. a very small percentage of dealers told me that they make a calculated risk and intentionally advertise misleading terms to increase sales traffic. i would not recommend this approach to advertising. who should oversee advertising at the store? the obvious answer is the compliance officer. every store should have one. the basic rules are quite straightforward and easily applied. every dealer should understand the basics. all automobile advertising should be in plain language and it should be “clear and conspicuous.” in other words, it should be written for someone who has a tenth grade education. there are tests for how complex the language might be (e.g., the flesch test). if a dealer wishes to evaluate its advertising text for plain language it could do so at this website: “clear and conspicuous” or “clearly and conspicuously” means that the language or visual representation is readily apparent and understood by the person to whom it is being addressed. factors to be considered for this purpose include size, color contrast, length and crawl time. advertising shouldn’t be deceptive. this is a subjective element and it means advertising should not mislead consumers by use of inferences, disclaimers, limitations, conditions, restrictions, exclusions, confusion, contradiction, portrayals, diagrams, charts, pictures, et cetera and so forth. there is both federal and state advertising law. under the truth-in lending act, and its regulations, reg m (leasing) and reg z (retail), it addresses leasing and credit advertising. in some states, adverting is addressed in both statutes and regulations. in other states, it may even merit its own “false advertising” statute. generally, advertising is outlined in the udap statute. if dealers wish to engage in credit sales advertising they must adhere to the truth-in lending act (tila), 15 usc §1601 et seq., and regulation z, 12 c.f.r. §1026. if dealers wish to engage in lease advertising they must observe the applicable provisions of the truth-in-lending act, 15 u.s.c. §1601 et seq., the truth-in-leasing act, 15 u.s.c. §1667 et seq., and regulations z and m (12 cfr §1013 et seq.), as amended, to the extent that each applies to lease advertising. these are simple rules and should be applied in every advertisement. objectionable advertising practices there are many examples of what a dealer shouldn’t do in his advertising. the following list contains the top twenty of the most common infractions but there are many more. dealers should take special note of these common errors. asterisks and footnotes by either contradicting or confusing the major message with asterisks and footnotes the ad can be made deceptive. print size using print size to hide important information, such that it is illegible, could deceive consumers. color contrasts utilization of color contrasts can prevent a consumer from seeing and understanding the advertisement. photographs and illustrations portraying a different model or vehicle in the ad, than the one that is being sold, is clearly deceptive. abbreviations the use of abbreviations such as wac or ccr, as though the average consumer can understand what is being presented, is misleading (wac means “with approved credit” and ccr stands for “capitalized cost reduction”). or the use of dealer jargon may be deceptive. advertised selling price the use of the sales price is, understandably, acceptable if it represents the complete price except for the tag, title, and taxes. the reference to the tag, title, and taxes should be indicated in the advertisement close to the selling price. availability if the vehicle is not in stock it should be so indicated. if the number of vehicles is limited, and will probably not satisfy the anticipated demand, the number of available vehicles should, in some fashion, be so indicated. advertising that the dealer is selling vehicles below market prices using terms such as “low prices,” “lowest prices,” and “guaranteed prices” are dangerous terms to use unless the dealer knows, and can demonstrate, that his vehicles are being sold at these comparative prices. price matching terms such as “we won’t be undersold” or “meet your best offer” can be utilized under certain advertized conditions. they must be explained clearly and must not burden the consumer too much to qualify for them. for example, requiring a consumer to have a signed buyer’s order, may violate the law since it may be impossible for the consumer to get such a signed document. disclosure of basis for price comparison using terms such as “30% off” or “save $1,500” are illusory if the realistic starting price isn’t disclosed. using the term “$1,000 off list price,” when the list price isn’t established, is construed to be deceptive. “sales” use of words which would imply that the consumer is actually saving money, when he is not, such as “discount,” “price cut,” “bargain,” “reduced,” or even “on sale,” for that matter, would be unlawful. if the dealer can establish that this new offered price is materially lower than what he offered recently he may avoid a violation of advertising law. “tent sale” is another term that must be used cautiously as it may have a state-specific definition. the same is true of the term “liquidation sale” or “public sale” implying a going out of business sale. “dealer cost” advertising that the dealer is selling vehicles at “dealer cost” is usually deceptive unless it’s true. other similar terms, which could present problems, are “factory invoice” or “inventory price.” duration of sale if the sale is scheduled for a certain limited time period it should be indicated. trade-ins ads which advise a consumer to “drag it in, pull it in, push it in, we don’t care, your trade-in is worth $7,000 this weekend!” where the new vehicle’s price will be increased by that amount, is clearly actionable. or, if this offer fails to disclose onerous conditions required to merit the trade-in amount, the advertisement would be concluded to be deceptive. dealer size statements implying that the dealer, due to its size or its volume, sells vehicles at a lower cost from the manufacturer, are generally unlawful unless it can be substantiated. “factory outlet” using fallacious terms such as “factory outlet” or “factory authorized sale” is deceptive when not true. “no money down” “no money down” may be acceptable if the consumer is informed that the tag, title, and taxes must be paid in cash. gifts and “free” merchandise if dealers wish to use the term “free,” or its alternatives, such as “without charge” or “bonus,” they should recognize that there should not be conditions for receiving whatever is being offered as “free.” dealers should consult their state law and the ftc’s guide concerning use of the word “free.” advertising of repurchased or specialty vehicles when advertising program cars, repurchased vehicles, brass hats, or executive cars those terms need to be explained in the ad such that the previous use of the vehicle can be understood as well as other material facts. state law may have specific requirements regarding these advertisements. bait and switch advertising bait and switch advertising is universally unlawful and easy to prove by regulators. there are numerous versions of this tactic all of which violate the law. free legal advice there is, indeed, free legal advice concerning advertising. dealers should visit these websites for some direction. the federal trade commission has an excellent website which all dealers should include in their website favorites. it addresses advertising especially well. a number of years ago the federal reserve convened a panel of experts and observers, regarding consumer leasing, and the panel produced a superb publication, keys to vehicle leasing, website, and training materials. under the tab “guide for educators,” on the website, advertising leases is portrayed pursuant to tila and reg m. just about any issue regarding leasing is addressed on this website as well. most attorneys general address vehicle sales and advertising on their websites. dealers should go to their state’s attorney general website for this information. conclusion i conclude this column by offering this sage epigram: deceptis non decipientibus, jura subveniunt “the laws help persons who are deceived, not those deceiving.” in other words, dealers should observe the laws of advertising or suffer the legal consequences. it’s not hard to do. govern yourselves accordingly. tags: advertising, compliance, laws, terry o'loughlin this

"i would tell him that the information came from a particular contact at marvell," motey told the jury.

(power, clock, reset line etc.). however the machine does have a proprietary cpu so finding just what pin does what might be a problem. if it was a z80 or 6502 it would be a lot easier.to my knowledge the hp85 units never had a fan. the processor is actually quite slow and it probably doesn’t get hot enough to warrant one. tez (terry stewart) (administrator)collection: ... /index.htmprojects and

by kaimaiguy on tue jul 19, 2011 1:59 pm dear sirs n ladies n germsi am so grateful for your kind input and for all the time you have taken to respond to my posts. as i said before i lack the lot tools, resources and know how. so when you suggest that i use a multimetter to check the whatsis on the cpu it's very vague to me.so far what i detect is a ticking sound which seems to be originating down in the right center of the power supply. this is s steady beat tick tick tick then sometimes it's not there at all. the diplsay is not steady either and only appears on occasional basis.the interior is very clean and i see little in the way of corrosion but probably doesn't rule out a good clean. just hoping to be able to get downtown sometime to get some alcohol hopefully.also unfortunately my own internet machine is riddled with problems i have a very slow rural dial up connection with kiwionline which makes surfing truly a miserable experience can't use utube etc just too slow. can't find this page can;t find explorer and can't even access my email half the time. my isp knows nothing.aside from the one chip missing all else seems to be there on the logic board and so far there are no apparent visable signs of any problem areas. this is why my thoughts remain with probable bad logic etc.thank you for the url to the tech manual i already downloaded it and many others that is why i felt ok about starting out on the project clear concise and proper disassembly instructions. ian emailed me and suggested that the machine may still be trying to access the other box it was connected to while in it's former use and that i might try to connect the interface that came along with it. so i guess nothing tried nothing gained. if this starts getting into a money thing i will simply have to ditch the project. i just don't like seeing a thing of beauty sleeping like this when it can be wide awake and enjoying it's continuing cyber life.again i thank you all for everythinghave the finest of days.cheers!rick kaimaiguy posts: 12joined: thu jul 07, 2011 6:03 pm top re: hp85b awakens by tezza on tue jul 19, 2011 2:08 pm kaimaiguy wrote:the interior is very clean and i see little in the way of corrosion but probably doesn't rule out a good clean. just hoping to be able to get downtown sometime to get some alcohol hopefully.is this to clean the corrosion or for medicinal purposes when you come to a blind alley in the diagnosis? i'm glad you have that manual. a ticking sound in the psu is not a good sign. in fact i would start there. make sure the right voltage is coming off the psu (be careful where you probe). it's best tested with the motherboard plugged in so it has some load. if the voltages being supplied to the board and vdu aren't correct and steady then this will cause a whole host of problems including all of the ones you describe.p.s. be very careful measuring around the vdu. there is high voltage around those things. hopefully that manual will suggest where to measure to check that you're getting correct power levels. tez (terry stewart) (administrator)collection: ... /index.htmprojects and articles: @classiccomputnz | youtube:

pm hi thank you very much for your postas i said before i have no clue as to how to do many of these operations. not sure where to put the probes etc and exactly what i am looking for. what do you mean by " the right voltage" what is the right voltage are we talking mains voltage , board voltage etc etc? also you say that the ticking is not a good sign what could some of the causes be?the alcohol was suggested by another older member here to clean up the boards, circuits etc. again however there is really no signs of visable corrosion.thanks for allrick kaimaiguy posts: 12joined: thu jul 07, 2011 6:03 pm top re: hp85b awakens by zl2aox on tue jul 19, 2011 3:53 pm the ticking sounds like high-voltage arcing due to insulation breakdown. if a damaged or discoloured component isn't apparent, it might be easier to spot in darkness. however, i'd strongly reiterate tezza's cautions - be very careful what you touch! zl2aox posts: 74joined: sun sep 12, 2010 12:30 pmlocation:

etc and exactly what i am looking for. what do you mean by " the right voltage" what is the right voltage are we talking mains voltage , board voltage etc etc? your manual should help with this. normally 240v goes into the psu and dc voltage goes out to the mainboard. just what this is and just how many dc lines there are depends on the computer. there is amost always a 5v one and often there is a 12v one and a -5v one also (on a computer as old as yours). however, it's possible some of those voltages could be generated on the board itself. anyway these dc voltages should be at the levels stated in the manual and stready. check the manual and see where these lines connect to the mainboard. measure them where the connect or close to where they connect, but before they go through any components. there are lots of other places you could also measure the voltages but you'd have to use the schematic to find them. i'm assuming you know how to use a multimeter?i agree with zl2aox that it sounds like your psu is shorting. it certainly shouldn't be ticking. it's possible that a capacitor has shorted perhaps or (more seriously) the insulation. if the voltages are out of wack on the board, that would confirm it.your psu would also have a (high voltage) lead to the screen. unless you really know what you are doing it would be prudent to stay way from this. there are high (lethal) voltages in that area, and the power doesn't even need to be on. i would advise strongly not to go near it with a probe (or anything) until you are a lot more skilled. in fact, a psu (especially a shorting one) can also be dangerous to novices so i would advise not poking around the psu as well.given the risk factor here, consider that this might be just a bridge too far. i was at about your level when i started tinkering around with these machines but i started on a really well known and well documented machine (apple ii+), had duplicate machines, and the issues were neither psu or screen. i also had an electronics mate (philip avery) to explain and assist from time to time. it took me a while to build up expertise before i would go near a screen or psu. even now they still make me nervous. tez (terry stewart) (administrator)collection: ... /index.htmprojects and articles: @classiccomputnz | youtube: terry stewarttrade me: tezza5 tezza site admin posts: 2311joined: thu jan

ailments located on the logicthere is a battery of of 3 silver cylinder caps which are c1 c2 and c3. two of these caps are blown out on one end the positve end of c1 and the negative end of ajoining c2. the leads appear to have been fried being a dark brown colour. these caps i believe supply/regulate the voltage to the crt ribbon cables which connect the logic pca to the large crt pca. this is also the exact area where i believe i heard the ticking sound.still looking for further dead soldiers which i expect to find but very hopefully do not. the very next hopeful thing is to be able to find replacements or suitable subs. i also believe that u21 pm021 (the missing dip) may have been essential rom to the machine thus another finger missing from the hand. this i am however unsure of as to whether or not this chip is essential to drive the neccessary logic to make the machine operational.will keep all posted on progressi thank you all again for your help and kind support during this first of my sojurns into bringing another ole timer back to the world of the living.cheers!rick kaimaiguy posts: 12joined: thu jul 07, 2011 6:03 pm top re: hp85b awakens by tezza on wed jul 20, 2011

bárou? pokud nezvládnete hned plný počet opakování posilovacích cviků, vůbec nevadí. postupně si počty opakování přidávejte. při posilování, nejenom břišních svalů, nezadržujte dech, nekmitejte, nešvihejte. bedra jsou vždy plnou plochou přitisknutá k podložce. bolesti zad, kdy je třeba vyhledat odborníka? civilizační onemocnění - bolesti zad bolesti zad patří mezi tzv. civilizační onemocnění. alespoň jednou v životě se s ním setkalo 80% dospělých lidí. kdy zvládnu bolesti zad sám? příčiny bolestí zad můžou být různé. jak rozlišíme, kdy si s bolestmi ještě můžeme poradit sami a kdy bychom už měli vyhledat odbornou pomoc?jedním z indikátorů, jak rozlišit druh bolesti je činnost, při kterých nás záda bolí.máte-li obtíže při dlouhém a neergonomickém sezení, pravděpodobně se jedná „pouze“ o bolesti zad v důsledku nevhodné statické zátěže a pomůže vám změna nastavení pracovního prostředí a zvýšení vaši denní pohybové aktivity. jestliže vás bolí záda při dlouhém stání, můžete patřit mezi jedince, kteří mají tzv. vadné držení těla ať už v důsledku anatomických poměrů (nastavení jednotlivých páteřních segmentů, případně pánve vůči sobě) nebo v důsledku svalové nerovnováhy. i tato příčina se dá do jisté míry řešit vhodnou pohybovou aktivitou a změnou pracovní zátěže. stres a bolesti zad dalším z významných faktorů ovlivňující bolesti zad je stres. někdy může být stres samotnou příčinou, jindy může být spouštěcím faktorem do té doby „spícího“ problému. významnou roli ve vzniku bolestí páteře hraje obezita, ale také nevhodná fyzická zátěž (nadměrná, jednostranná,…). máte-li bolesti zad nebo i jiných částí pohybového aparátu při určitém sportu, je to známka toho, že něco děláte špatně. někdy pomůže jedna konzultace s fyzioterapeutem, který příčinu odhalí a doporučí, jak ji odstranit. kdy vyhledat odbornou pomoc pro bolesti zad? kdy bychom měli zpozornit a vyhledat odbornou pomoc? jestliže vám bolest propaguje do dolních končetin, třísel nebo břicha, může jít o funkční nebo i strukturální poruchu páteře, se kterou si už neporadíte sami a je vhodné vyhledat odbornou pomoc (fyzioterapeuta, rehabilitačního lékaře, neurologa). fyzioterapeut vám po vyšetření pohybového aparátu v souvislosti s vaší anamnézou stanoví příčinu obtíží, kterou vám pomůže vyřešit nebo vás odešle k dalšímu nutnému vyšetření k odbornému lékaři.dalším z indikátorů bolestí zad, kdybychom měli vyhledat odbornou pomoc, jsou noční bolesti, ostrá bolest v reakci na kýchnutí nebo nemožnost najít úlevovou polohu. někdy můžou být bolesti zad první známkou nějakého interního onemocnění, kdy dochází k jeho manifestaci v rámci tzv. vertebroviscerálních vztahů (každý orgán se projevuje specifickým obrazem funkčních poruch na pohybovém aparátu). i s tímto si zkušený fyzioterapeut dokáže poradit, případně vás odeslat k dalšímu odborníkovi. mgr. lenka hellebrandová fyzioterapie u vás doma hledáte odborníka, fyzioterapeuta? víte, že můžete mít odbornou

nutné nejen pravidelně sportovat, ale také během dne zvýšit pohybovou aktivitu v rámci adl (activity of daily living – aktivity denních činností)-chůze do schodů místo výtahů, vystoupit o zastávku dřív, apod. trochu pohybu na pracovišti neuškodí změny polohy mezi sedem a stojem během pracovního dne uleví napětí v zádech, zlepší posturu a dýchání a pomůže celkovému „wellbeing“.kdo židli má bydlí, kdo stůl, ten pracuje - ergonomie práce u pc hlava se v běžném životě nastavuje tak, abychom mohli sledovat dění kolem sebe. a nejen to: už s pohybem očí, natož pak s pohybem hlavy, se připravují všechny svaly na těle. s nastavením hlavy je reflexně spojená aktivita veškeré muskulatury těla. při pohledu vzhůru a záklonu hlavy začnou automaticky aktivovat nebo i prohýbat bedra (a „špulit pozadí“). také úklon hlavy aktivuje více svalstvo na straně úklonu.fyzioterapie - svalová přetížení, pohybové stereotypy to, jak vstaneme ze židle, kolik uděláme kroků, a jakým způsobem zvedneme horní končetinu k vypínači světla, jak pracuje u počítače s myší, jsou procesy, které se dějí zcela mimovolně, bez našeho soustředění na jednotlivé úkony. často se stává, že při běžných denních činnostech některé svaly používáme nadměrně a jiné svaly z funkce vynecháváme a jakoby opomíjíme. tím pak dochází k chronickému přetěžování určitých oblastí, jež může mít za následek i strukturální změny.fit test – test životního stylu test je sestaven na základě tzv. evidence based medicine (medicíny založené na důkazech) pomocí upravených dotazníků uznávaných odbornými společnostmi. mapuje úroveň pohybové aktivity, jídelníček, odolnost vůči stresu, zátěž pohybového aparátu a rizika civilizačních onemocnění. ke každé oblasti životního stylu vám dle výsledků fit testu udělí pro fit známku (1- nejlepší, optimální stav a 5 – nejhorší, vysoké riziko). ke každé známce je navíc doplněn podrobnější komentář a osvědčené tipy, co by vám v dané oblasti mohlo pomoci.jak vznikají špatné pohybové stereotypy, poruchy pohybu poruchy pohybu mohou mít původ nejen ve strukturální patologii, ale už ve změnách nebo selhání podmínek pro realizaci pohybu. z klické praxe vyplývá, že porucha funkce bývá často příčinou bolestí a jestliže trvá déle, způsobuje prokazatelné morfologické změny. na druhé straně každá morfologická porucha vyvolá cetrální odpověď a vzniká soubor funkčních změn, které můžeme identifikovat a terapeuticky ovlivnit.posilování břišních svalů a hluboký stabilizační systém páteře bránice a pánevní dno tak tvoří dva jakési písty, které působí proti sobě shora a zdola, čímž roztlačují polštář orgánů břišní dutiny do zbylých směrů - vpřed a do stran, resp. vzad. zde se uplatňuje funkce příčného břišního svalu, který se aktivuje excentricky a brzdí pohyb obsahu břišní dutiny vpřed a do stran - při nádechu se proto zvětšuje obvod pasu.technika správného bráničního dýchání při cvičení tento způsob dýchání je základem všech dalších cviků, protože dochází prostřednictvím aktivity břišních svalů a pánevního dna k aktivaci nitrobřišního tlaku, což je nutné pro správnou stabilizace páteře.svaly, tuky, kosti, voda…vyšetření tělesného složení chcete hubnout? děláte všechno správně, jídelníček skvělý, pohybu dost a dost každý den, a přeci se na váze nic neděje? nezoufejte, vše může být na dobré cestě. mnohdy na začátku hubnutí sice ubývá tuk, ale pokud jste navýšili pohybovou aktivitu, začne také přibývat žádoucí svalová hmota - "kilo za kilo", takže na "váze" se zdánlivě nemusí nic dít. zda optimálně hubnete, zjistíte nejspolehlivěji kontrolou tělesného složení.workshop - vše o pohybu workshop o keckách, tepovkách, minutách, svalech, pevném bříšku a šmrncovním pozadí. dozvíte se, kolik je třeba pohybu k redukci hmotnosti a kolik ke zlepšení zdravotní prognózy. jakou volit efektivní pohybovou aktivitu právě pro vás. naučíte se hlavní zásady rozumného posilování a tolik potřebného protažení. poskytneme vám

tuhle báječnou svačinku. a budete možná překvapení, že špenát může v kombinaci s ovocem takto chutnat.kdy může pohyb škodit našemu srdci? smyslem mého článku není odrazování od pohybu a zastrašování, nýbrž naťuknout, kdy mohou srdeční rizika hrozit. příznivé účinky pravidelného pohybu v mnoha ohledech převyšují efekt léků. pohyb nám dělá dobře od hlavy k patě, ať už se jedná o prevenci deprese, zlepšení kognitivních schopností (tj. lépe nám to pálí) zlepšení srdečně-cévního aparátu, prevenci cukrovky, která nás svým výskytem válcuje, jak nikdy před tím. máme čím dále více podkladů, že pravidelná fyzická aktivity také významně ovlivňuje výskyt nádorů. osoby, které pravidelně sportují, se v průměru dožívají o 7 let více než jejich vrstevníci se sedavým způsobem života.jak předcházet zažívacím obtížím při vytrvalostním výkonu zásadní role zažívacího traktu při sportovním výkonu tkví v dodávce tekutin a živin. gastrointestinální (gi) neboli zažívací obtíže v plné šíři dle statistik postihují 30-90% vytrvalostních běžců. studie mezi vytrvalostními triatlety udává dokonce výskyt gastrointestinálních obtíží u 93% závodníků. gi obtíže jsou patrně nejčastějším důvodem zhoršeného výkonu při vytrvalostních závodech a ovlivňují následně i regeneraci.jahodové smoothie s mandarinkou jednoduchá snídaně, svačinka nebo prostě „něco dobrého na zub“. díky tvarohu či jogurtu, tj. obsahu bílkovin, má smoothie dobrý sytící efekt.okurkové smoothie jako snídaně či svačina zcela jednoduchý nápoj, který zvládne úplně každý, kdo má doma mixér, může posloužit jako snídaně či skvělá svačinka.jak předejít syndromu přetrénování i když nejsou jednoznačně objasněny patofyziologické mechanismy syndromu přetrénování, je jisté, že se příznaky liší u sportovců s převažujícím vytrvalostním tréninkem a těch, kteří trénují silově. přetěžování velkými objemy způsobí symptomy spíše jako u aerobních sportů, nadměrná intenzita má symptomy spíše jako u anaerobních sportů.recept - báječný cheesecake z avokáda nejtěžší je na tomto jednoduchém dortíku se udržet a nechat ho vychladnout. příprava je vskutku jednoduchá: mícháme, dorovnáváme, mícháme a zarovnáváme. díky tvarohu či riccotě obsahuje bílkoviny, tím pádem má nízký glykemický index a díky avokádu i krapet zdraví prospěšných tuků.animal flow - posilování celého těla animal flow je nový druh cvičení, který vychází ze zvířecích pohybů. jedinečnost animal flow pro mě tkví v tom, že zvýší sílu, pružnost, vytrvalost a to vše najednou. cviky zahrnují celé tělo, je hodně využívána opora horních i dolních končetin, tím pádem je posílena i horní číst zad, která běžně velmi často „pokulhává“ za zbytkem těla.protažení po běhání-statický stretching po běhání je optimální protahovat až v delším časovém odstupu po doběhu. klidně po „sprše“, večer…těsně po doběhu svaly ještě pracují a nepřiměřené protažení by je mohlo poranit. protažení po běhání je statické. je to plynulý pohyb do dané pozice, ve které vydržíme, plynule dýcháme a s výdechem vždy tak o 1-2cm protažení zvýšíme.protažení před běháním-dynamický stretching před během provádíme tzv. dynamický stretching. dynamický stretching je protažení v pohybu, kdy pohyby jsou plynulé, většinou krouživé, bez hmitání, bez kmitání. cílem je připravit na běh velké svalové skupiny, hýždˇové svaly, svaly dolních končetin.uvolnění a protažení zad z jógy, prevence bolestí beder nemusíte být zkušenými jogíny a i tak si užijte staletími ověřené jógové cviky k protažení, uvolnění zejména spodní části zad, beder, k uvolnění oblasti pánve, kyčlí. ženám přinesou úlevu i v době menstruačních bolestí.recept - muffiny z ovesných vloček a řeckého jogurtu jednoduché, šťavnaté muffiny ke snídani nebo svačince. za 10 minut připravíte a pak ještě na půl hodinky do trouby.cvičení před počítač k mírnění negativních dopadů dlouhodobého sezení někdy stačí velmi málo. prevencí je krátké, jednoduché cvičení, které zabere maximálně minuty a odcvičíte ho přímo na pracovním místě. cvičit lze v kanceláři, v autě, stačí i pár sekund, kdy strnulou pozici přerušíme, protáhneme se a tím kompenzujeme jednostrannou zátěž.10minutový trénink bez pomůcek na každý den -

relaxace pomocí foam roller čím víc využijeme při pohybu elastických vlastností fascií, tím víc ušetříme práci svalům, pohyb je energeticky úspornější, efektivnější. fascie mají vliv i na správné

posilování břišních svalů mít optimálně posílené břišní svaly není jen o vizuálním efektu plochého bříška. břišní svaly se podílí na správném postavení pánve a také zjišťují v průběhu pohybu podmínky pro správné zapojení svalových skupin na téměř celém těle. systém břišního svalstva je rozložený mezi okrajem hrudního koše a pánví a tím také zajišťuje správnou polohu vnitřních orgánů v břiše. podílí na jejich správné funkci – trávení, krevním oběhu, vylučování. břišní svaly se také podílí na dechovém stereotypu a dechových funkcích.dechová relaxační cvičení umíte správné dýchat? víte, že dýchání je nejčastější pohybový stereotyp, který provádíme chybně? dech ovlivňuje v našem těle vše a stejně to platí i naopak. při stresu, radosti se nám dech zrychlí, metabolické pochody ovlivňují

máme tendenci zvednout ramena a vytáhnout je směrem k uším, předsunout bradu dopředu, vyhrbit horní část zad, většinou povolíme a „vyvalíme“ břicho. k tomu ještě negativně přispívá, že většinu dne v práci prosedíme, což je pro naše tělo také nepřirozená pozice. dlouhodobým sezením jsou přetěžované ohýbače stehna a oslabené hýžďové svaly.jak poznám podezřelé kožní znaménko? může to být melanom?

běžecká zranění většinu zranění z běhu zvládnete vyléčit s využitím níže uvedených tipů sami. nejlepším pomocníkem při léčbě běžeckého zranění nám je naše vlastní tělo. neběhejte přes bolest „take it easy“ a naordinujte si běžecký klid. to však neznamená vzdát se pohybu. místo běhu jděte plavat, zařaďte cyklistiku, jogu, pilates, vše záleží na charakteru a lokalizaci bolesti.ukázkový jídelníček pro aktivní ženu s ukázkovými jídelníčky se v poslední době tak říkajíc "roztrhl pytel". mým krédem je, že jídlo mi musí chutnat - ať již se snažím hubnout či nikoli. pokud se v období diety trápím, nutím se do jídel, které nemám ráda, odpírám si to, co miluju, těším se, až to skončí, velmi pravděpodobně zase naberu vše, co jsem shodila. zdravý životní styl vás musí bavit, jinak není trvale udržitelný. nabízím vám pár mých oblíbených jídel na snídani, svačinky, oběd a večeři.„tabata“ cvičení k posílení celého těla máte málo času na cvičení anebo se vám vaše cvičení zdá nudné? zkuste ho rozfázovat do intervalů. mně osobně v poslední době nadchlo cvičení dle „tabata protokolu“ pro většinu z nás známé prostě jako tabata. toto schéma fázování cvičení ve vysoké intenzitě vymyslel izumo tabata, profesor na ritsumeikan univerzitě v mém oblíbeném kyotu. výhoda vysoce intenzivního intervalového cvičení je kombinace posilování a zároveň zlepšení aerobní zdatnosti a to vše v jednom. vyzkoušejte intenzivní cvičení na 32 minut, ve kterém zapojíte svaly celého těla.jak jíst při nepravidelné pracovní době, při nočních směnách. při nepravidelné pracovní době, nočních směnách, se pravidelný jídelní systém dodržuje mnohem obtížněji. vzhledem k tomu, že náš organismus je fyziologicky naprogramován tak, že když slunce zapadne, měl by odpočívat, spát, je dobře poskládaný jídelníček při práci v noci o to důležitější. předejdeme tak únavě na těle i na duchu a také nežádoucímu přibývání na váze, pro které je práce v nočních provozech rizikem.prevence běžeckých zranění mezi nejčastější běžecká zranění patří patelofemorální syndrom, iliotibiální syndrom, mediální tibiální stresový syndrom, plantární fasciitida neboli syndrom patní ostruhy.pojďme projít hlavní zásady, jak se zraněním z běhu vyhnout.glykemická nálož glykemický index a glykemická nálož není to samé. zatímco glykemický index je relativní hodnota, glykemická nálož je hodnota absolutní, možno říci konečná. glykemická nálož v sobě zahrnuje glykemický index a množství sacharidů, které potravina obsahuje. glykemická nálož nám konkrétně popíše, nakolik budou muset zapracovat naše langerhansovy ostrůvky ve slinivce, které po snědení konkrétního množství potraviny s obsahem sacharidu musí vyloučit hormon inzulín.abdomino-gluteální index, waist-hip ratio, poměr pas-boky abdomino-gluteální index (agi), waist-hip ratio, neboli poměr pas-boky, jsou parametry k posouzení rozložení tělesného tuku. vyplynul z poznatku, že více rizikové je uložení tělesného tuku v horní polovině trupu.jak předcházet bolestem zad z dlouhých přejezdů autem? cvičení za volantem. sed není pro lidské tělo přirozená poloha, a proto je velmi důležité naučit se správně sedět. obzvláště při dlouhých přejezdech v autě za volantem.cviky při bolesti krční a hrudní páteře, posílení svalů břišní stěny bolesti v oblasti hrudní a krční páteře často vznikají v důsledku špatné koordinace pohybu, kdy dochází k přetížení horních fixátorů lopatek (m. trapezius, m. levator scapulae) a následně k přetížení krční páteře. častou chybou je izolované posilování přitahovačů lopatek, které způsobí „uzamčení“ hrudní páteře a znemožní tak její rotabilitu, tj. možnost „točení“ v plném rozsahu. přinášíme 4 komplexní cviky na oblast hrudní a krční páteře a posílení břišní stěny.kde bolí nejčastější zranění z běhu nejčastější běžecká zranění bolí pochopitelně na dolních končetinách. hlavními bolestivými oblastmi jsou kolena, zevní strana stehna, přední strana bérce nad vnitřním kotníkem, dolní část paty. jaké syndromy tyto bolesti způsobují?pitný režim během sportovního výkonu jednoduchá kontrola, zda během sportovního výkonu optimálně pijeme, je, že před a po tréninku, resp. sportovním výkonu, byste měli mít stejnou hmotnost. u žen, které se denně neváží, může být hmotnost zkreslena fází menstruačního cyklu, kdy většinou v druhé polovině cyklu díky hormonálním změnám, může žena vážit o 1-2 kg více.co je medicína založená na důkazech (evidence based medicine) v dnešní době zahlcené informacemi je mnohdy těžké se rozhodnout, které tvrzení je to správné. jedna studie tvrdí x a druhá y, ten má osobní pozitivní zkušenosti s tím a ten zase s oním. někdo nedá dopustit na tradiční medicínské postupy, jiný je příznivcem psychosomatického přístupu nebo čínské medicíny, ještě jiný zase nedá dopustit na moudra různých celebrit. zajímavé na tom je, že většinou jsou tyto skupiny vzájemně nesmiřitelné a v různých internetových diskusích neuvěřitelně bojovní za tu „svou“ teorii. kdo tedy má pravdu? která studie něco skutečně potvrzuje a která je jen zaplacená farmaceutickou, potravinářskou či jinou firmou, která je jen výsledkem nějakého spiknutí?viscerální manipulace, propojení pohybového systému s vnitřními orgány víte, že existuje propojení mezi pohybovým systémem a vnitřními orgány? víte, že fyzioterapie vám může pomoci třeba i s bolestmi břicha? viscerální manipulace (vm) byla vytvořena a je neustále rozvíjena světově uznávaným francouzským osteopatem a fyzioterapeutem jeanem pierrem barralem od 80.let minulého století. barral zjistil a vědecky podložil oboustranné propojení mezi vnitřními orgány a hybným systémem.vysoce intenzivní intervalový trénink- co, kdy a jak? vysoce intenzivní intervalový trénink využívá a zlepšuje jak aerobní tak anaerobní kapacitu, zatímco kardio trénink zlepšuje aerobní zdatnost. při vysoce intenzivním intervalovém tréninku, střídáním intenzity zátěže vyžíváme různé energetické zdroje, které jsou při aerobní aktivitě odlišné než při aktivitě anaerobní.výsledky studií popisují, že 27 minut intenzivního intervalového tréninku 3x v týdnu, odpovídá 60ti minutám aerobního cvičení s vyrovnanou intenzitou 5x týdně.avokádová pomazánka s cottagem

či škodlivé. záleží na celém kontextu životního stylu, množství a skladbě přijímaných tuků i dalších živin, míře fyzické aktivity, genetických dispozicích.není bílkovina jako bílkovina aneb biologická využitelnost biologická využitelnost bílkovin udává, kolik bílkoviny z přijatého množství ve stravě se skutečně použije na biologické procesy v těle - novotvorbu a regeneraci svalů, tvorbu hormonů, krevního barviva, imunoglobulinů a spousty dalších látek v těle.recept - pečená červená řepa červenou řepu už známe z babylonie, byla oblíbená i ve starém říme. je to skvělá velmi hodnotná zelenina, která příznivě působí na náš organismus, jsou jí připisovány účinky někdy až neuvěřitelné… nicméně je fakt, že obsahuje množství minerálů, kromě sodíku také draslík a vápník, je zdrojem vitamínu c a vlákniny. používá se za studena i za tepla. jeden z těch „za tepla“ receptůmléko a mléčné výrobky, význam mléka a mýty o jeho konzumaci mléko a mléčné výrobky zaujímají v naší stravě významné místo. zároveň je tato pozice podkopávána různými mýty, které ohledně produkce, zpracování a konzumace těchto výrobků v populaci kolují. mléko je jedna z nejlépe vyvážených potravin a výrobky z něj tvoří v místním regionu významnou složku našeho jídelníčku. nejčastěji konzumujeme mléko a kravské, ale stranou nezůstává ani ovčí a kozí, a to i jako surovina pro stále oblíbenější mléčné výrobky. legislativně je získávání a zpracování mléka vymezeno po stránce zdravotní nezávadnosti nařízeními eu v rámci tzv. hygienického balíčku (zejména nařízení č. 852/2004 a 853/2004) a také dalšími i národními předpisy, které řeší rozdělení mléčných výrobků na druhy, skupiny, případně podskupiny a jejich označování (vyhláška č. 77/2003 sb. ve znění její poslední novely č. 336/2013 sb.).recept - sušenky z avokáda avokádo je asi nejvíce energeticky náročné ovoce, ale má k tomu zřejmý důvod. avokádo obsahuje kvalitní tuky, které mohou využít ti, kteří nemají rádi ryby. obsah tuků závisí na úrovni zralosti plodu. zralé avokádo má tmavě zelenou až černou barvu. dužina zralého avokáda je měkká, dobře se roztírá a má žlutou barvu, pecka jde lehce vyloupnout. v kuchyni lze avokádo použít bez složitých úprav k pomazánkám, skvělému, rychlému guacamole a nebo třeba do sušenek…recept - cuketové placičky z quinoi, vydatná svačina nebo kvalitní lehký oběd proč quinoa? merlík chilský neboli quinoa je snad potravina snů, obsahuje vše, co bychom v jídelníčku rozhodně měli mít. jak už název napovídá, merlík chilský k nám dorazil z chile, bolívie a dalších států jižní ameriky. vypadá sice jako obilovina, ale patří do skupiny pseudoobilovin, stejně jako pohanka. jejich nespornou předností je, že neobsahují lepek, a proto je vhodný i pro celiatiky.jaké jsou druhy prevence jaké jsou druhy prevence proti nemocem se dá bojovat na dvou úrovních: 1. jejich léčbou 2. jejich předcházením neboli prevencí prevenci můžeme rozdělit na několik druhů 1. primární prevence cílem primární prevence je u zdravé osoby, která dosud nestoná,odhalit případné rizikové faktory, které by se mohly podílet na rozvoji onemocnění v budoucnosti. praktický příklad: dostatečnou pohybovou aktivitou, racionálním jídelníčkem a mírněním stresu eliminujeme obezitu jakožto možnou příčinu třeba vysokého krevního tlaku.e - booky čekají na vás vymazlené e-booky zdarma či za symbolický peníz. každá kniha se věnuje některému z velkých témat zdravého životního stylu – fit jídelníčku včetně receptů a postupu přípravy, pohybu i motivaci, hubnutí, prevenci nemocí, cvičení na bolavá záda, pevné břicho a šmrncovní pozadí.tuky, oleje a různé druhy kuchyňské úpravy přepalované tuky jsou nositeli trans-mastných kyselin (s rizikem pro srdečně-cévní systém), volných radikálů a dalších karcinogenních látek. jak se vyvarovat zbytečného ohrožení zdraví a připravit chutná jídla s použitím kvalitních tuků a olejů?nemyslete na veverku ve žluté kombinéze - rozhovor s marií skalskou lékařka marie skalská je prototypem moderní ženy, i když se mnohým vlastně na první pohled může jevit spíš jako super žena. vedle péče o rodinu se třemi dětmi, které vede k lásce k pohybu, stíhá totiž řadu dalších aktivit - přednáší na ftvs uk a vede vlastní firmu, kde učí ostatní ženy, jak žít lépe.přínosy a nebezpečí kuchyňské soli pro naše zdraví neznamená to však, že bychom měli sůl ze svého jídelníčku nadobro vyřadit. některé studie dokonce potvrzují, že i enormě nízký příjem soli zvyšuje riziko srdečně-cévních onemocnění. sůl v našem těle hraje roli při hospodaření s vodou a udržování nervo-svalové dráždivosti. kuchyňská sůl je často zdrojem velmi potřebného jodu, který je nutný pro optimální činnost štítné žlázy.co nám nejvíce chybí v jídelníčku – vláknina kdybych mohla kouzelným proutkem změnit jediné v českých běžných jídelníčcích, zvýšila bych množství vlákniny. její účinek je téměř všemocný - na srdce, na střeva, jako prevence mnohých civilizačních onemocnění. co si budeme povídat - naše tělesná a duševní pohoda je mimo jiné definována tím, zda se dobře najíme, vyspíme a pravidelně chodíme na záchod.e-book pohyb a redukce hmotnosti v e-booku naleznete odpovědi na otázky proč se hýbat, jakou pohybovou aktivitu zvolit, abyste měli šanci u ní vydržet, jaká intenzita pohybu je vhodná k redukci hmotnosti, co jíst před a po cvičení a na co je při cvičení nutné rozhodně pamatovat.formulace cíle do „formy“ má šanci na úspěch. analýza smart je hodně užívaná u pracovních cílů, někomu může vyhovovat, někomu v ní něco chybí. na treninku nlp (neuro-lingvistického programování), který jsem loni absolvovala, jsem si velmi oblíbila i metodu „formování“ cíle, záměru, předsevzetí, přání, snu či jakkoli tomu chcete říkat. forma jsou vždy první písmenka určitého aspektu, jak lze na cíl pohlížet.workshop - pro ženy na vahách pro ženy, které mají chuť něco změnit, přestože jim nezbývá moc času pro sebe. celodenní workshop věnovaný rovnováze životního stylu v mnoha ženských rolích. zaměříme se na optimální stravování, zdravý pohyb, kompenzační cvičení, zajímavé techniky posilování motivace a vůle. všechny informace a techniky jsou na vysoké odborné úrovni, aktuální a mnohokrát prověřeny.e-book jak být fit v 9 krocích životní styl vnímáme jako trojnožku, jejíž nožky jsou optimální pohyb, kvalitní strava a psychická pohoda. jak to všechno vyvážit, aby se člověk cítil fit? všechny nožky trojnožky musí být stejně dlouhé. ještě než se pustíte do zdravého jídelníčku, intenzivního cvičení či dlouhé meditace, pojďme se zamyslet, jaké kroky je třeba udělat, abychom cíle dosáhli.glykemický index – proč pečené a vařené není to samé? odborná definice glykemického indexu zní: glykemický index (zkratka gi) je bezrozměrná veličina, která udává rychlost využití glukózy tělem z určité potraviny. srozumitelně psáno je to hodnota, o kterou se nám zvedne hladina krevního cukru, poté, co sníme jídlo, které obsahuje sacharidy a následně se zase sníží, tím jak inzulín přijatý cukr začne odsunovat do buněk.e-book inspirativní fit jídelníček je pro vás jídlo požitek? následující jídelníček s recepty by pro vás měl být inspirací, nikoli dogmatem, které je třeba striktně dodržovat. nemám předepsané jídelníčky vůbec v oblibě a nedávno jsem se úplně zděsila, čím vším se mohou lidé tak striktně řídit, jak chudou a monotónní stravou se živit. je zřejmé, že nemůžeme všichni jíst totéž a při tom hubnout. proto je dosti obtížné správně zvolit ukázkový jídelníček – nikdy nebude vyhovovat specifickým nárokům každého individuálního člověka. zvolily jsme tedy jakýsi „zlatý standard“ s energetickým obsahem 6 000 – 6500 kj.pohádka o čokoládě - je čokoláda hřích nebo spíše lék? čokoláda bývá často prvním příkladem potraviny, kterou je třeba si odříct, když chci hubnout, jíst zdravě. bývá také tématem novoročních předsevzetí – ve smyslu „už nikdy nedám čokoládu do úst“. na druhou stranu však je i častým typem dárků, vždyť, co lepšího můžeme darovat, než luxusní pralinky, že? čokoládou také mnohdy řešíme stres anebo si naopak užíváme slastný hřích.workshop - nechci být tlustá a unavená unikátní víkendový workshop pro ženy, které chtějí být fit i při

palmitové kyseliny je velmi vysoký (k 40 %), srovnatelný s obsahem olejové kyseliny. obsah polyenových kyselin je naopak velmi nízký – obsah linolové kyseliny je okolo 11 %, obsah linolenové kyseliny je zanedbatelný. porovnáním s hodnotami v tabulce iii je vidět, že ostatní rostlinné oleje mají daleko příznivější složení mastných kyselin. dokonce i u vepřového sádla je složení mastných kyselin srovnatelné – samozřejmě, na rozdíl od palmového oleje je sádlo významným zdrojem cholesterolu.kokosový tuk ano či ne? odborné výživové hodnocení kokosového tuku z mnoha různých pojednání, která lze číst zejména na internetu, může čtenář nabýt pocit, že kokosový tuk je nejzdravějším a z výživového hlediska nejlepším tukem (někdy dokonce bývá označován jako „superpotravina“). bohužel, většina těchto pojednání je skrytou reklamou výrobců a distributorů. z výše uvedených údajů je také vidět, že tvrzení některých výrobců, že „nezdravý“ mléčný (živočišný) tuk nahradili „zdravějším“ rostlinným tukem je zcela zcestné a vůbec nerespektuje složení a fyziologické působení kokosového tuku. stejně tak jde mimo realitu i doporučení používat kokosový tuk (z důvodu jeho přirozeně vysoké oxidační stability) pro smažení.deklarace nezávislosti od světa posedlého hmotností ode dneška navždy prohlašuji, že jsem si vybral/a žít nadále svůj život podle následujících zásad. na základě mého rozhodnutí

být zvýšen hormonálně, když nám nadledvinky vylučují větší množství hormonů, které tlak zvyšují, než by se slušelo. vysoký krevní tlak také může způsobit zúžení aorty, to vede následně ke zvýšení tlaku v horní polovině těla. pokud tyto příčiny odhalíme, je skvělá šance na jejich řešení a tím pádem normalizaci tlaku. jednoduchou matematickou si spočítáme, že je tu pak „zbylých“ 90%, kdy jasnou příčinu hypertenze neznáme.zase jsem to nezvládla, dobrá kamarádka a jak správně na dřep „jsem to ale husa...už to nemá cenu...zase jsem to nevydržela...já na to nemám...nestojím za nic...všechno

dobrá je, že čas běží pro všechny stejnou rychlostí a je na každém z nás, jakým způsobem s touto luxusní komoditou hospodaříme.kdy je potřeba napnout všechny síly- prediabetes prediabetes je pozvolna se vyvíjející přechod mezi metabolickým syndromem a rozvojem cukrovky 2. typu. ve fázi prediabetu není organismus schopný udržet optimální rozmezí hladiny krevního cukru, ale ještě nejsou dosaženy patologické hodnoty, které by splňovaly diagnózu cukrovky 2. typu. stanovení diagnózy prediabetu je velmi zásadní, je to období, kdy je možné rozvoji cukrovky 2. typu předejít.každý 3. čech, každá 5.češka ho má...metabolický syndrom metabolický syndrom je kumulace rizikových faktorů srdečně cévních onemocnění. pokud je vám diagnóza metabolického syndromu přiřknuta, vězte, že vaše riziko úmrtí na srdečně-cévní onemocnění se zvyšuje 3.6x. v čechách se metabolický syndrom se vyskytuje u 32,5% mužů a 21,4% žen.není cholesterol jako cholesterol hladiny krevních tuků jsou významným rizikovým faktorem srdečně-cévních onemocnění, cukrovky a dalších nemocí. nárok na vyšetření cholesterolu a jeho jednotlivých frakcí v rámci preventivního vyšetření u svého praktického lékaře máte v 18, 40, 50 a 60 letech, některé pojišťovny hradí vyšetření i ve 30ti letech.co vám nikdo neodpáře? onemocnění srdečně cévního aparátu vzniká nejčastěji na podkladě aterosklerózy. ateroskleróza je dlouhodobý, mnoho let trvající proces, který začíná v našich tepnách již v dětství. představte si jak, z hladké, pružné tepny se širokým průsvitem se stává rigidní, zúžená, tuhá trubice, která je náchylná k ucpání krevní sraženinou a k prasknutí. tyto nežádoucí změny mohou vyústit v infarkt myokardu nebo mozkovou příhodu. u každého jedince je rychlost postupu aterosklerotických změn individuální a je ovlivněna přítomností rizikových faktorů. rizikových faktorů je několik desítek, ale ty zásadní, které naši zdravotní prognózu nejvíce ovlivní, můžeme spočítat na prstech obou rukou.kolik a jak často je potřebná fyzická aktivita pro náš zdravotní benefit výsledky jedné z největších studií na téma fyzické aktivity, která byla provedena na čtvrt milionu osobách (leitzmann et al. 2007) potvrzuje, že opravdu každý krok a každá minuta strávená fyzickou aktivitou je pro naší zdravotní prognózu prospěšná. ve studii byli účastníci rozděleni do 4 skupin - 1. skupina neaktivních osob, ve 2. skupině nedosahovali probandi celkových doporučení stran fyzické aktivity, splňovali však doporučení 150minut středně náročné fyzické aktivity týdně.proč přijít na workshop pro fit institutu? naše workshopy jsou zaměřeny na konkrétní témata životního stylu, mezi něž patří jídelníčky, cvičení, motivační techniky, mírnění stresu. respektujeme individuální životní potřeby, rozdílný životní rytmus, a proto i cesty k fyzické a psychické pohodě jsou pro každého z nás různé. nevalíme šrouby do hlavy (jak se vyjádřil jeden z účastníků naší akce), ale spojujeme do souvislostí ověřená fakta. ukazujeme různé úhly pohledu, ze kterých si vyberete pro vás ten optimální. řekli o nás výborný seminář “výborný seminář. po dlouhé době jsem se během tohoto školení nedíval na blackberry.” (ladislav kovář, citibank, o workshopu a bit of pro fit) příjemné, zajímavé setkání „příjemné, zajímavé setkání umožňující pozastavit se a koncentrovat na důležité otázky. nejvíce oceňuji fundovanost, připravenost a uvěřitelnost vás lektorek.“ (jana jirasová, hr, procter and gamble, o workshopu 5 kroků k fit realitě) bezvadně zpracované „bezvadně zpracované, zábavnou formou, bez zbytečných kudrlinek podané téma zlepšení životního stylu. motivující seminář s přehledem základních informací a hlavně je člověk veden k zamýšlení nad vlastními cíli.“ (jana o workshopu pro ženy na vahách) jsem ráda, že jsem se účastnila „jsem ráda, že jsem se semináře účastnila. dozvěděla jsem se spoustu zajímavých a praktických informací přestože mi tato témata nejsou cizí – dobrá inspirace a nakopnutí.“ (helena o workshopu srdeční záležitost) velice mě to bavilo „velice mě to bavilo - cviky, motivace, „špeky“. vyhovovala mi přátelská atmosféra a věřím, že mě to ještě víc nakopne.“ (tereza o workshopu 5 kroků k fit realitě) po našem semináři napsala "úžasné prezentující odbornice, témata,co mě zajímají – info do života pracující ženy s malým dítětem." (daria, zentiva, o workshopu a bit of pro fit ) na našem semináři ocenil "velmi přínosné po všech stránkách, velmi oceňuji odborný background (většina např. poradců ve výživě nemá medicínské vzdělání a je to poznat)." (michal urban, zentiva, o workshopu a bit fo pro fit) co se na semináři líbilo "velmi odborně a vtipně připraveno a vedeno. šikovné návody na cvičení, zdravou stravu. ochotné odpovídání na dotazy." (karolína svobodová, zentiva, o workshopu a bit of pro fit) proč klademe velký důraz na formu prezentace "velmi profesionální prezentace a zajímavý a přehledně členěný obsah." (anita, zentiva, o workshopu a bit of pro fit) jak hodnotil náš seminář "nově a zajímavě podané ve své podstatě známé skutečnosti." (václav, zentiva, o workshopu a bit fo pro fit) jaké že to bylo? "bylo to věcné. žádné přesvědčování o tom co je a není dobré což velmi oceňuji. bylo to pro mě srozumitelné. celkově to je velká motivace sama o sobě." (jitka snášelová, rwe o workshopu den pro fit) k čemu workshop nabudil? "záživný, plný informací, cvičení. nabuzení k tomu dělat něco sama se sebou – stanovení cíle." (martina záhorszká, rwe, o workshopu den pro fit) co se líbilo? co bylo dobré? "líbil se mi projev obou paní doktorek. zajímavé bylo aktivní zapojení posluchačů. také bylo dobré ochutnat „zdravé“ jídlo, které připravily během přestávky." (aranka nováková, rwe, o workshopu den pro fit) jak workshop udržoval pozornost? "zajímavý, nebyl nudný, udržoval pořád pozornost díky cvičením a hrám." (účastník, rwe,o workshopu den pro fit) to je naším cílem "shrnutí a dávání do kontextu věcí, které už jsem kolikrát různě slyšel, ale neviděl jsem souvislosti. podáno zábavnou formou." (josef, mašek, rwe, o workshopu den pro fit) co bylo na worskhopu největším přínosem? "úžasné prezentační schopnosti. velký přínos především v praktických ukázkách, vysvětlování na příkladech."(nicole wagnerová, rwe, o workshopu den pro fit) co se hodí pro život? "žádná strohá teorie ale mnoho praktických a hlavně využitelných tipů." (vendula blažková, rwe, o workshopu den pro fit) workshop mě nakopl "vrátila jsem se po mateřské dovolené do zaměstnání a bylo toho najednou moc. worskhop mi pomohl urovnat si priority, pochopit, že není nutné být ve všem 100% a že pokud budu spokojená já, bude spokojené i moje okolí". (petra o workshopu pro ženy v pohybu a s nadhledem) smysluplně prožitý den "je to smysluplně prožitý den. skvělá atmosféra, perfektní organizace, velká motivace! doporučuji všem." (jitka jagerská o workshopu pro ženy na vahách) co hned uplatňujeme? "školení bylo úžasné, praktické. kolegové si stáhli krokoměry, sdělují si průběžné výsledky☺️. stojí kde mohou... já sama sleduji, kde všude je glukózofruktozový sirup a víc přemýšlím, jaký olej použít. informace hned aplikujeme v praxi."

las informaciones sobre la evolución y futura trayectoria de la tormenta tropical emily. autor: instituto de meteorología publicado: 21/09/2017 | 05:12 pm como resultado de la disminución de la velocidad de traslación de la tormenta tropical emily, sus efectos pueden alcanzar al territorio de esta provincia en la próxima noche y madrugada, reporta la ain. presidida por vivian rodríguez, jefa de la defensa civil, en la segunda reunión de hoy del consejo de defensa provincial se alertó que lluvias localmente intensas se esperan en los municipios mayarí, frank país, sagua de tánamo y moa. rodríguez, también vicepresidenta del órgano de la defensa en la provincia, apuntó en la cita que holguín se prepara para afrontar la peor de las variantes, con racionalidad y eficacia en la protección de las personas y los recursos de la economía. los 14 consejos municipales de defensa y grupos de trabajo, informaron de las acciones ejecutadas en las últimas horas, especialmente de las labores encaminadas a preservar los recursos alimentarios almacenados, la situación de los medios electrógenos y las comunicaciones, entre otros temas. una medida acatada con celeridad fue el retorno de los vacacionistas de las playas y la suspensión de la totalidad de las actividades náuticas, cuando ya se esperan las primeras marejadas en el litoral. el municipio de mayarí reportó que se prepara para evacuar a vecinos de la presa de nipe, que actualmente vierte, mientras frank país indicó la salida preventiva de las 29 familias que residen en canal 5. en estos casos, la prioridad es trasladar a las personas hacia las casas de vecinos y familiares que ofrezcan las condiciones de seguridad adecuadas, aunque otros destinos están listos para recibir evacuados cuando se decida. manuel paneque, delegado del instituto nacional de recursos hidráulicos en el territorio, señaló que las 18 presas y dos derivadoras están preparadas para asimilar importantes volúmenes de lluvias. comparte esta

__label__low naar de inhoud springenxooz blogalgemeen gezever en af en toe een dansje maak een backup van je wolk de gmail outage van gisterenmorgen–op twitter al ludiek gfail genoemd–heeft mij ertoe aangezet nog eens al schrijvend na te denken over wat cloud computing nu eigenlijk zou moeten zijn. the fruits, the pitfalls, the good, the great and the downright evil of web applications. bear with me.google mail, of kortweg gmail, kan zowat gezien worden als een tipping point in de geschiedenis van het web. het was de eerste online mailservice die grotere bijlagen toeliet (nu tot 20 megabyte) en een online opslagcapaciteit van maar liefst 1 gigabyte aanbood (ondertussen al meer dan 7 gb). maar dat was niet de enige belangrijke vernieuwing die zoveel mensen heeft overhaald om van hun hotmailaccount af te stappen. gmail was ook de eerste webmailservice die bovenop de extra opslagcapaciteit conversaties introduceerde; een belangrijke functie die ik alvast niet meer zou kunnen missen. als klap op de vuurpijl was (en is) het hele boeltje virtueel gratis, want het wordt betaald met google’s advertentie-inkomsten.na google’s maildienst volgden er nog vele andere online applicaties waarmee je je data gratis in “de cloud” kan opslaan. de cloud is een abstract begrip voor velen. het is misschien nog het makkelijkst te omschrijven als een wolk van digitale data, gevormd door een netwerk van computers en toegankelijk via éénderwelke internettoegang ter wereld (behalve in china dan, misschien). wat daarvan het gevolg is, is echt fantastisch: je data zijn altijd en overal beschikbaar, omdat ze in de cloud zijn opgeslagen. op reis in spanje en geen laptop mee, maar toch een belangrijk mailtje nodig? geen probleem: een computer met internettoegang en je kan meteen je mailtje opzoeken. wil je meteen de foto’s die je op reis genomen hebt delen met je vrienden en familie? sure thing, gewoon online gaan, de foto’s op je flickr- of facebookaccount zetten en ze zijn daar for the world to see.gisteren was er echter eventjes paniek in wolkenland. gmail was voor verschillende mensen niet meer bereikbaar via de webservice (gmail.com of googlemail.com). dat zorgde onder andere op twitter voor nogal wat commotie. afgezien van het feit dat ik een bijna blind vertrouwen heb in de medewerkers en meer specifiek de technische staff van google (komaan: ze doorzoeken het hele internet in gemiddeld 0,15 seconden!) vond ik het toevallig de dag voordien nodig om een backup te nemen van mijn gmail bedrijfsaccounts. ik heb gewoon de pop-functie ingeschakeld en dan thunderbird ingesteld om regelmatig alle e-mail te downloaden. met de juiste filters en instellingen heb ik zelfs helemaal geen “last” van die one-way backup en kan ik bovendien gemakkelijk mijn mails terugvinden.cloud applicaties zijn leuk. meer zelfs: ik vind ze fantastisch en ik zou niet meer zonder kunnen, maar zoals met alle data is het altijd verstandig om een backup te bewaren. nu, google maakt ongetwijfeld backups op zo’n manier dat ik zelfs geruster kan zijn dat de hel op mijn hoofd valt, dan dat mijn data onherroepelijk zouden verdwijnen. maar dat neemt niet weg dat een menselijke fout of, god forbid, kwaad opzet er altijd voor kunnen zorgen dat er toch wat misloopt. dat is de reden waarom ik al mijn mails nog eens via pop3 download, waarna ze op geregelde intervallen via time machine automatisch naar mijn backupschijf worden weggeschreven. dat is de reden waarom ik zelf al mijn foto’s op mijn harde schijf bewaar. en dat is de reden waarom ik voorlopig met iets meer terughoudendheid naar webapplicaties kijk. is er geen mogelijkheid tot het makkelijk bewaren en synchroniseren van online en offline data? dan gebruik ik de applicatie niet om belangrijke data op te slaan.ps: voorlopig nog in pre-bètafase, maar ongemeen interessant om ook offline toegang tot je mail te houden is de nieuwe gmail labs offline feature auteur xy&zgeplaatst op 2009-02-252009-02-25categorieën technologie en wetenschaptags backup, cloud, data, gegevens bram hah, ik doe net het omgekeerde! alle dingen op mijn lokale schijf opslaan, en ze periodiek laten synchroniseren met “maar bram, heb je dan geen schrik dat andere mensen je gevoelige data kunnen bekijken?” nee. bram hah, ik doe net het omgekeerde! alle dingen op mijn lokale schijf opslaan, en ze periodiek laten synchroniseren met “maar bram, heb je dan geen schrik dat andere mensen je gevoelige data kunnen bekijken?” nee. xavez hmm… gebruik je dan ook gmail via pop3?

__label__low milliet информационное издание всетатарского общественного центра (втоц) понедельник, 3 марта 2014 г. илларионов: "в украину прибыл спецназ, который будет убивать россиян" андрей илларионов экс-советник президента рф владимира путина андрей илларионов считает, что российских военнослужащих отправили в крым на смерть. в интервью каналу 1+1 илларионов сказал, что российский президент готов пожертвовать собственными военными и простыми российскими гражданами, пребывающими в украине, чтобы предъявить это в качестве провокаций, совершенных со стороны украины. – на территории украины уже сейчас находится несколько групп российского спецназа. не только титушки, не только российские туристы, которые вывешивают российские флаги на те или иные администрации, а группы российского спецназа, задача которого: открывать огонь и убивать российских граждан и российских военнослужащих на территории украины, для того, чтобы предъявить это в качестве провокаций, - утверждает экс-советник путина. - именно так действовали российские части на территории грузии в южной осетии, когда российский спецназ расстрелял российских же офицеров и потом тела этих офицеров были предъявлены в качестве доказательств убийства российских миротворцев грузинами. facenews- автор: milliet на 10:40 комментариев нет: отправить комментарий следующее предыдущее главная страница подписаться на: комментарии к сообщению (atom) при перепечатки материалов с информационного издания milliet втоц, ссылка на него обязательна.контактtatar_center@yahoo.com недовольных ждет - смерть, избиения, тюрьмы или психушки, а довольных - в рабы! коран.ру медина.ру каталог татарских ресурсов tat net forum ндп ватан азатлык международное татарское радио татары оренбурга татарский чернобыль.трагедия уральских татар милли меджлис татарского народа тпнн иттифак tatar forum info ислам.ру татарлар.ру татары петербурга мтсс.ру татполит.ру татары урала архив блога ► 2015 (10) ► июня (1) ► марта (1) ► февраля (4) ► января (4) ▼ 2014 (1803) ► декабря (99) ► ноября (133) ► октября (145) ► сентября (132) ► августа (105) ► июля (133) ► июня (132) ► мая (211) ► апреля (217) ▼ марта (247) в вопросе крыма власти украины и россии могут дойт...

"after the gold rush: california, cannabis & the election" by marijuana price data firm cannabis benchmarks looked at what happened after recreational legalization in washington, colorado and oregon to come to its conclusion. washington oregon, in particular, saw rising weed prices in response to legalization, including a $200-per-pound spike, to a price of $1,941, late last year, and a 12 percent spike again this year, according to the paper. the first increase was a result of dispensaries stocking up to meet increased demand; the second was a response to a "supply bottleneck" as regulations forced retailers to buy product that had been tested by accredited laboratories, according to analysis.jonathan rubin, ceo of cannabis benchmarks, explained that the following factors could increase postlegalization prices in california:compliance: proposition 64 will mandate licenses for growers and sellers, and it will regulate packaging and labeling. this stuff costs money.stocking up: dispensaries will engage in "advanced buying to make sure their shelves are stocked" on jan. 1, 2018, when, if 64 passes, anyone with a heartbeat and an id proving they're 21 or older can walk into a dispensary and buy pot, rubin said. demand: because almost anyone will be able to buy weed, demand is expected to multiply. higher demand can mean higher prices.testing: mandatory product testing not only slows down the supply line and adds costs for producers but it also means that noncompliant product can be held and even destroyed, rubin explained. less supply can mean higher prices. if you like this story, consider signing up for our email newsletters. show me how x newsletters all-access pass to the top stories, events and offers around town. no thanks sign up x success! you have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in! these are all factors that contributed to price increases in other states that have legalized recreational marijuana. however, rubin acknowledges that california is a different beast. he says experts generally agree that about 80 percent of america's weed comes from the golden state. outdoor growers here have massive capacity, and that might help to mitigate some price fluctuation.but rubin says he believes consumers will still see higher-priced pot. "in almost every commodity market, the end user is the one costs get passed on to," he says.the increases could be temporary, part of a "boom-bust cycle" where entrepreneurs rush into an emerging market and create so much product and so much competition that prices soon level off. "when prices are high it attracts more players, you have more competition, more supply, and price goes down," rubin says."longer-term, prices will stabilize as market forces reach equilibrium," he says. "this will afford existing cultivators and early entrants the opportunity to optimize their operations and secure their competitive position." dennis romero is an l.a. weekly staff writer. he formerly worked at the philadelphia inquirer and the los angeles times, where he participated in pulitzer prize-winning coverage of the l.a. riots. his work has appeared in rolling stone online, the guardian and, as a young stringer, the new york times. contact: dennis romero follow: twitter: @dennisjromero popular stories the search for spirituality and wellness is driving new image... who knew? six famous potheads in history skid row's walk the talk parade celebrates the community and... this year, in california at least, 4/20 is for everyone, pot... ©2018 la weekly, lp. all rights reserved. newsletters all-access pass to the top stories, events and offers around town. top stories send: sign up > remind me later > no thanks > privacy policy newsletters all-access pass to top stories, events and offers around town. sign up > no thanks! remind me later >

related reports this econometric study covers the latent demand outlook for fresh fruit juices and nectars across the prefectures and cities of japan. latent demand (in millions of u.s. dollars), or potential industry earnings (p.i.e.) estimates are given across some 1,000 cities in japan. this statistical approach can prove very useful to distribution and/or sales force strategies. using econometric models which project fundamental economic dynamics within each prefecture and city, latent demand estimates are created for fresh fruit juices and nectars. this report does not discuss the specific players in the market serving the latent demand, nor specific details at the product level. the study also does not consider short-term cyclicalities that might affect realized sales. the study, therefore, is strategic in nature, taking an aggregate and long-run view, irrespective of the players or products involved. this study does not report actual sales data (which are simply unavailable, in a comparable or consistent manner in virtually all of the cities in japan). this study gives, however, my estimates for the latent demand, or the p.i.e., for fresh fruit juices and nectars in japan. it also shows how the p.i.e. is divided and concentrated across the cities and regional markets of japan. table of contents: 1 introduction 101.1 overview 101.2 what is latent demand

সেখানে লুকিয়ে আছে আপনার দাম্পত্য ক্ষমতা! আপনার জন্ম তারিখ কবে? সেখানে লুকিয়ে আছে আপনার দাম্পত্য ক্ষমতা! আপনার জন্ম তারিখে ঠিক হয় রাশিফল। সেই রাশিফল বলে দেয় আপনার ভাগ্য। শিক্ষা, চাকরি, বিয়েই শুধু নয়, আপনার দাম্পত্য ক্ষমতার রহস্যও লুকিয়ে রয়েছে রাশিচক্রে। শুধু আপনার নয়, সবার। তাই ডেটিংয়ে যাওয়ার আগে জেনে নিন আপনার সঙ্গীর জন্ম তারিখটা। মেষ (২১ মার্চ-১৯ এপ্রিল) মেষ রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা সব সময়ে সব কিছুতেই নেতৃত্ব দিতে ভালবাসেন। খেলার মাঠ থেকে বিছানা— সব জায়গায়। দাম্পত্যের সময়ে এঁরা সঙ্গীর উপরে নিয়ন্ত্রণ করতে পছন্দ করেন। তাই কারোকে কারোকে খুশি করতে পারলেও অনেক সময়ে সঙ্গীকে হারাতে গিয়ে নিজেই হেরে যান। বৃষ (২০ এপ্রিল-২০ মে) বৃষ রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা সাধারণত হালকা চালে মেলামেশা পছন্দ করেন। খুব একটা আগ্রাসী হন না। দাম্পত্যের মধ্যেও রোমান্টিকতা খুঁজতে চান। সম রাষির জাতক-জাতিকা হলে দাম্পত্যের অন্য মাত্রায় পৌঁছে যায়। তবে অনেকেই এটা উপভোগ করেন না। তাই সঙ্গীর জন্ম তারিখ জেনে নিয়ে প্রস্তুত হন। মিথুন (২১ মে-২০ জুন) মিথুন শব্দটার মধ্যেই আছে রহস্য। এই রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা দাম্পত্য নিয়ে শিল্প করতে ভালোবাসেন। আপনি সব সময়ে চাইবেন উপভোগ্য পরিবেশ। আর সেটা পেয়ে গেলে আপনি সঙ্গীকে চরম সুখ দিতে পারেন। তবে এই রাশির মানুষ যে কোনও পরিস্থিতির সঙ্গে মানিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তাই সঙ্গীর মন বুঝে দাম্পত্যর বিভিন্ন রূপ খুঁজে বের করে নিন। কর্কট (২১ জুন-২২ জুলাই) আপনাদের সহজে চেনা যায় না। পেটে খিদে মুখে লাজ কর্কট রাশির একটা বড় বৈশিষ্ট্য। আর মুখ দেখে ভোলাভালা মনে হলেও বিছানায় এঁরা দুরন্ত ফর্ম নিতে পারেন খুব কম সময়ের মধ্যেই। আগ্রাসী হয়ে সঙ্গীকে চরম সুখ দেওয়ার ক্ষেত্রে আপনাদের জুড়ি আপনারাই। একটা বিষয় মনে রাখা দরকার, প্রতিবারই আগ্রাসী দাম্পত্য আশা করা ঠিক নয়। সিংহ (২৩ জুলাই-২২ অগস্ট) সিংহ রাশি মানে ভাববেন না বিছনাতেও সিংহ-বিক্রম কাজ করবে। এই রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা সাধারণত সঙ্গীর মন বুঝে দাম্পত্যে মাততে পারেন। আপনাদের ক্ষেত্রে দেখা যায় দুর্বল রাশির সঙ্গী পেলে তার উপরে আগ্রাসী হয়ে যান। কিন্তু সেটা সব সময়ে সুখের হয় না। সব সময়ে আগ্রাসী হতে না পারলেও দাম্পত্যের ক্ষেত্রে আপনারা বিলাসিতা পছন্দ করেন। কন্যা (২৩ অগাস্ট-২২ সেপ্টেম্বর) কন্যা রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা অন্তরঙ্গ মুহূর্ত উপভোগ করতে ভালোবাসেন। দীর্ঘ ফোর-প্লে আপনাদের খুব পছন্দের। দাম্পত্যের মধ্যে গল্প করে, কথা বলে আপনারা পরস্পরকে আকর্ষণীয় করে তুলতে পারেন। বিছানায় রোম্যান্টিকতা কাকে বলে, তার নিদর্শন রাখেন আপনারা। যে কোনও রাশির সঙ্গীর সঙ্গেই আপনারা জমিয়ে তোলেন। উপভোগ্য হয় দাম্পত্য । তুলা (২৩ সেপ্টেম্বর-২২ অক্টোবর) বিছানায় আপনারা পছন্দের সঙ্গী খুঁজতেই ব্যস্ত থাকেন। সকলের সঙ্গে আপনারা দাম্পত্য উপভোগ করতে পারেন না। তাই দাম্পত্যের ক্ষেত্রে আপনারা খুবই খুঁতখুঁতে হন। তবে পছন্দের সঙ্গী পেলে আপনারাই বিছানায় তুফান তুলতে পারেন। দাম্পত্যকে অন্য পর্যায়ে নিয়ে যাওয়াই হয়ে ওঠে আপনাদের লক্ষ্য। কিন্তু যখনই পছন্দের সঙ্গী মেলে না তখনই আপনাদের কাছে দাম্পত্যটা দায়সারা হয়ে ওঠে। বৃশ্চিক (২৩ অক্টোবর-২১ নভেম্বর) বৃশ্চিক রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা বিছানায় হিংস্র হয়ে উঠতে পারেন। আউটডোর দাম্পত্য আপনাদের দারুণ পছন্দের। হাটে-মাঠে দাম্পত্য করা মন্দ নয়। তবে লোকলজ্জা বলেও তো বাজারে একটা কথা রয়েছে। সেটা মনে রাখবেন। ধনু (২২ নভেম্বর-২১ ডিসেম্বর) ধনু রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা একটু আধটু নয়, খুব ডার্টি দাম্পত্য পছন্দ করেন। সর্বত্র উত্তেজনা খোঁজেন। ফোন দাম্পত্য দারুণ পছন্দের। অনেক সময়ে সঙ্গীর উপরে জোর খাটান। ফলে সঙ্গী উপভোগই করতে পারেন না। জোর করা বন্ধ করে সঙ্গীকেও সুযোগ দিন। মকর (২২ ডিসেম্বর-১৯ জানুয়ারি) অনেকেই মনে করেন, সব চেয়ে বেশি কামুক হন মকর রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা। কিন্তু এটা ঠিক নয়। আপনারা শুধুই কামুক নন। আপনদের মধ্যে দাম্পত্যের পাশাপাশি সঙ্গীর প্রতি গভীর ভালোবাসাও টের পাওয়া যায়। মুড ভাল থাকলে আপনারা বিছানায় সঙ্গীকে দারুণ দাম্পত্য উপহার দিতে পারেন। কুম্ভ (২০ জানুয়ারি-১৮ ফেব্রুয়ারি) আপনি কুম্ভ রাশির জাতক হলে মনে রাখবেন, আপনার সঙ্গী আপনার কাছে যেমন সুখ চাইবেন আপনি বেশ সময়েই সেটা দিতে পারেন না। আসলে আপনার মধ্যে একটা হতাশা কাজ করে। আপনি খুঁতখুঁতে না হলে আবার উপভোগ্য হয়ে ওঠেন। আপনার যোগ্য সঙ্গী হতে পারেন ধনু রাশির জাতক বা জাতিকা। মীন (১৯ ফেব্রুয়ারি-২০ মার্চ) মীন রাশির দাম্পত্য মানে ‘লাভ মেকিং’। জাতক-জাতিকারা ভালোবাসার খোঁজে নানা রকমভাবে দাম্পত্য পছন্দ করেন। বারবার সঙ্গী বদলাতে পছন্দ করেন। তবে যথাযথ সঙ্গী না পেলে আপনারা হতাশ হয়ে পড়েন। আবার পছন্দের সঙ্গী পেলে মীন রাশির জাতক-জাতিকারা দাম্পত্যকে অন্য মাত্রায় নিয়ে যেতে পারেন। জন্ম তারিখ রাশিফল 2017-10-01 admin share facebook twitter google + linkedin tags জন্ম তারিখ রাশিফল related articles রাশি অনুযায়ী জেনে নিন ২০১৮সালের কোন মাস আপনার জন্য সেরা! january 27, 2018 রাশি অনুযায়ী জেনে নিন ২০১৮ সালে আপনার আর্থিক ভাগ্য কেমন january 8, 2018 রাশিফল দেখে জেনে নিন কেমন যাবে আপনার ২০১৮ সাল! january 6, 2018 কোন রাশির জাতকরা যৌনতায় সেরা?

"ho comprato le bomboniere solidali di humana per il mio matrimonio. mio marito, carlo, all’inizio non era molto d’accordo. lui è tradizionalista (e mia suocera ancor di più!), voleva andare in un negozio (magari anche più di uno), vederne di diversi modelli e di diversi prezzi. quindi quando gli ho proposto di avere delle bomboniere solidali vi potete immaginare la sua espressione! poi si è convinto a visitare il sito di humana e quando ha visitato la pagina del progetto che sostenevamo con le nostre bomboniere non ho più potuto fermarlo! vedere i visi dei bambini, sapere che nel nostro giorno più bello avremmo potuto aiutare anche tutti quei faccini ha fatto sì che carlo prendesse la decisione più forte in tutta l’organizzazione del nostro matrimonio: sfidare sua mamma e le cose "fatte alla vecchia maniera"! posso solo dire grazie a humana, le bomboniere sono state apprezzate da tutti e ammetto che oltre all’impegno di solidarietà che esprimevano erano veramente bellissime, tutte fatte a mano e recapitate in tempo."giovanna. "ho sempre voluto fare la volontaria, ma prima lo studio, poi il lavoro, il matrimonio e i figli me lo hanno sempre impedito. quando dovevamo decidere cosa fare per la comunione di matteo non ci sono stati dubbi: scegliamo un agriturismo, pochi invitati e soprattutto facciamo le bomboniere solidali! sono capitata nel sito di humana e il mio matteo ha scelto dei simpaticissimi portachiavi con gufi e uccellini ed io mi sono innamorata di un progetto così semplice ed efficace che dà cibo, istruzione e assistenza sanitaria a bambini orfani. adesso guardo l’unico portachiavi che c’è rimasto a casa, matteo l’ha voluto in cameretta, a volte la sera mentre gli leggo la storia della buona notte lo guarda e mi dice: sai mamma, forse uno dei bimbi che abbiamo aiutato comprando il gufetto sta anche lui ascoltando una storia…..ed io capisco che ho proprio fatto la scelta giusta.”maria “ho scelto le bomboniere solidali di humana perché sono un affezionato, un volontario dell’associazione da anni. quando ho deciso di fare il grande passo con lucia non potevamo che scegliere di fare le bomboniere con humana, un dono che avesse un valore più nobile. ancora una volta grazie a humana di aver capito le esigenze di chi ha di fronte, abbiamo proprio trovato le bomboniere che facevano per noi!”gianluca. “un veloce grazie a humana per le sue bellissime bomboniere! alla comunione di mia figlia con i segnalibri di legno abbiamo fatto un figurone!”patrizia. “io non ho ordinato le bomboniere solidali di humana, le ho ricevute. al matrimonio di luca, il mio più caro amico, ho ricevuto questa bella scatolina e dentro scopro che non ci sono solo i confetti…c’è l’aiuto ai bambini orfani e svantaggiati in zambia. allora, io e la mia fidanzata abbiamo deciso di fare un regalo speciale agli sposi post-matrimonio, visto che eravamo i due testimoni dello sposo: abbiamo attivato per loro un sostegno a distanza per un bambino in zambia. luca e paola sono rimasti contentissimi, hanno avuto la prova che le loro bomboniere solidali erano state apprezzate e capite e adesso hanno un legame speciale con un bambino lontano.”cristiano. “i gufetti sono bellissimi, la mamma mi ha detto che siete stati voi a farli e che così abbiamo aiutato dei bambini poveri! grazie per averceli mandati. ma non si può scrivere a quei bambini? mi piacerebbe molto, ma se voi gli telefonate vi prego, ditegli che serena li saluta!”serena 9 anni. “grazie humana per le bellissime bomboniere! sono stata felicissima di avervi scelto per ricordare la mia laurea e grazie ancora per avermi dato la possibilità di essere d’aiuto ai bambini in africa”donatella. il tuo nome* e-mail* ripeti e-mail* scrivi la tua testimonianza* se vuoi inserire una fotografia (formato jpg - max 300 kb) liberatoria per la pubblicazione*acconsento alla pubblicazione del mio nome, della testimonianza e della fotografia (se allegata) sul sito www.humanaitalia.itaccetto home | il progetto | testimonianze | chi siamo | contatti | faq | . | mappa generale del sito torna ai contenuti | torna al menu per poter utilizzare questo sito è necessario attivare javascript.

tollywood movie reviews agnyaathavaasi movie review, rating, story, cast and crew agnyaathavaasi movie review, rating, story, cast and crew twitter facebook google + pinterest rating: (3/5) director: trivikram srinivas cast: pawan kalyan, keerthy suresh, anu emmanuel banner: haarika & hassine creations producer: s. radha krishna music: anirudh ravichander release dt : jan, 10 2018 story agnyaathavaasi is all about abhishikth bhargav (pawan kalyan) who leads a secret life because of the rivals of his father govind bhargav (boman irani). the day arrives after his father gets brutally by his opponents after which the whole world arrives for the successor of ab group which govind owns. it is during this time, govind’s wife indrani (kusbhoo) sets a deadline of abhi’s arrival. the rest of agnyaathavaasi is all about the arrival of the prince in his style and how he treats his rivals. watch agnyaathavaasi to know about the complete story. analysis the first half of agnyaathavaasi looks pale and poorly written. one expects a strong set of episodes from trivikram along with some entertaining episodes that went missing completely in agnyaathavaasi. the songs have been placed well and they have been shot well across some beautiful locales. the action episodes have been shot well and the interval episodes make a massive impact. on the whole, the first half of agnyaathavaasi looks decent. the second half of the film manages to stand tall for twenty minutes but it dips down again as the film proceeds. the songs look decent and the entertainment keeps the audience engaging. though the major plot has been left deviated, the focus stands completely on pawan kalyan. the rest of the episodes how abhi retains the business empire have been loosely executed and the climax has been quite simple. on the whole, the second half of agnyaathavaasi too has been just ok and misses the mark of trivikram badly. performance pawan kalyan takes the lead as abhi and he tops the show with his flawless performance. he tried his best to save agnyaathavaasi and his screen presence has been exceptional. the actor has been outstanding in the emotional episodes. boman irani has been subtle and he steals the show with his performance in the crisp role. kusbhoo has been extremely emotional and she has been quite expressive throughout. keerthy suresh looks fit and has been decent. anu emmanuel looks extremely glamorous and is a treat for frontbenchers. all the other actors delivered out their best for the film. the story of agnyaathavaasi has been inspired from the french film largo winch. the screenplay and the dialogues lack the mark of trivikram which is a huge disappointment for the film. the music and the background score have been soothing and apt for the film. the cinematography is the major asset for the film along with the lavish production values that make the film look rich in each and every frame. agnyaathavaasi should be appreciated for the technical aspects and trivikram’s work for agnyaathavaasi will be badly criticised. final word pawan kalyan and the lead actors steal the show with their impeccable performances throughout but trivikram’s poor writing skills make agnyaathavaasi an average watch. stills from this movie videos & trailers twitter facebook google + pinterest tagged under : agnyaathavaasi movie review

on one topic. if you are passionate enough to write a blog about one topic, then this article offers plenty of valid advice for making that blog more efficient. use the information and tips contained in this article to help you learn more about creating a successful blog. if you are serious about blogging, buy a custom domain name rather than hosting your blog on a free service like blogger. it is fairly inexpensive to purchase your own name, and it will give you a more professional appearance. using your business’s name or something related to it will make it easier for viewers to remember it. a good way to get more traffic to your blog is by making comments on other’s blogs. google reader allows you to organize your blogs by folder. make a folder for the blogs you most want to follow so that you can find them when you want them. whenever you have the urge to say something, make a comment on them. your blog should be unique, so it stands out in the crowd. stick with interesting, unique content. providing information that is difficult for people to find will also draw readers. post content about a unique experience or hobby. give the intimate details of how a widget is constructed. this way, you give readers reasons to read your blog if they need certain information. frequently write in your blog. one of the biggest mistakes bloggers make is not updating the blog often enough. even if readers love your blog, they’ll lose interest if they have to wait a long time for updates. a great idea is to make a new blog update weekly and update your readers by email. make use of images within your posts often. many people say that a picture is worth 1000 words. there’s no better place to prove how much more pictures are worth to readers than within a blog–they are a vital part of your communication. image are capable of conveying much more than mere words. for this reason, you should include as many images as you can within your blog. update your site regularly. in order to keep your current subscribers visiting your blog, you need to keep giving them new content to read. regular new content will also help you to attract new visitors. if you neglect to add new articles to your blog, you will rapidly find that your readership decreses. try to aim for posting at least one time every day. allow occasional guest posts on your blog. this helps you build up connections with other bloggers, which is a helpful tool. do not disregard the importance of building cooperative relationships. you might need a favor in the future, and the blogger with whom you’ve been exchanging guest posts might be happy to help you. blog about topics that people want to know about. everyday chores like dusting and doing the laundry really aren’t so interesting. unless your blogs are unique when writing about common topics, people won’t read it. pick a topic that you know will interest people. running a blog success, after all, relies on your ability to attract readers. post lots of new content on a regular basis, as this will keep readers hungry for more quality posts. the majority of the most successful blogs post a new entry at least once per day. if you think this may be difficult for you to achieve, put together advanced material that you can later add daily prior to the initial launch of your blog. this will mean that you still have some content to post even if you have a day when you can’t write anything. be sure your blog offers something that is different from all others. readers will be attracted to unique information. posting difficult to find information will also do wonders for your blog. talk about unusual and interesting events and experiences. provide minute details about the way a widget is created. the idea is to provide readers with a reason to look for posts on your site. read all of your comment,s and try to respond to any feedback given without taking it too personally. people will always criticize you no matter what the topic is. if constructive criticism is posted, consider using it to make your blog better. for negative comments that are more destructive, leave a polite and brief response and don’t look back. by being mature when dealing with commenters, you’ll get more respect from your readers and you may attract new readers. use images in your posts. you must have heard that a picture is worth 1000 words. it is certainly true in terms of writing a blog. image are capable of conveying much more than mere words. thus, it makes sense to supplement your posts with images whenever you can. when it comes to gaining traffic on your blog, you need to focus on providing interesting, informed and inspirational articles. readers will return if they think your articles are high quality and interesting. don’t forget about the logistics. this means doing all the boring maintenance chores that needs to be done, as well as updating parts of your design from time to time. this will help readers from getting bored, and will also ensure that nobody has a problem visiting your blog. a topic that excites your interest and passion is particularly important when you make a blog. when you write about things you have a genuine interest in, your writing will be much better. this will translate well to your readers, increasing their commitment to return. mailing list remember to select effective keywords which are unique and less competitive. don’t use common keywords that many bloggers are already using; there’s too much competition for these keywords. it’ll be difficult for readers to find your blog if you use these keywords. be unique if you want to get the reader’s views. create a mailing list when you start your blog. if you create the list early enough, it will have ample time to grow. having a list of email addresses of those who have opted in to read your content can be useful for additional communication opportunities in the future. not beginning a mailing list early can be a huge mistake. the longer your posts are, the more you need to make sure that you are separating the article appropriately, and using subheadings. that will make your blog more readable, which will give you bigger readership. by utilizing this simple step, you boost your blogging skills to a higher level. don’t just write a lot of content without a game plan. your articles need to be well researched and relevant to your target audience and keywords. if you don’t put thought into what you’re writing, your blog probably won’t become successful. remember, the success of your blog is determined by the content you produce for it. your love and enjoyment of your blog is integral to its success. blogging can become boring, and thus be boring to readers if you aren’t passionate and involved in what you are writing. whatever topics you love, blog about them. blogging should be fun. stay creative, happy and upbeat, and your readers will reflect their enjoyment by sharing your content with others. it will make your blog have integrity if you stick to a schedule that is regular. there are new blogs going up all the time, and if you don’t stay consistent with your postings, people might look to another blog. while you should feel free to take breaks around the holidays or other special occasions, frequent posting should be your goal. be certain you keep your keywords italicized and bolded. this will make the article pop, and also make search engines more likely to notice your site. if a keyword is unique, more readers will be intrigued and click on it. think about designing your blog posts using bullet lists, italics, bold text and other ways that will stand out within your blogging niche. this will make search engines rank your site higher and will increase views on your site. this piece of advice is quite powerful and can help you in a number of ways. create a dynamic and different kind of home page. on most blog sites, the homepage appears as a list of all the recent posts. try to make yours more interesting by customizing your homepage. this is particularly important because your blog will probably be discovered through search engines or links. when blogging, try not to keep things too simple. learn constantly, always research and think of this like it’s a business. learn from other seasoned bloggers, and incorporate different strategies and techniques that you pick up along the way. continuously improve and learn about new blogging methods that will help you move forward. use interlinks within the content of your blogs. this allows your readers to easily navigate your blog, keeping them happy. there’s nothing worse than when you can’t find what you’re looking for on a confusing site. bolding and italicizing keywords can be helpful. this makes your keywords stand out to readers and search engines alike. setting your keywords apart from other text in this manner attracts people’s attention and makes them more likely to read your content. focus on other bloggers who are in your niche and make sure you are one step ahead. your blog is in competition with theirs, and it’s important that you know what they’re doing. also remember that while you are looking at their sites, there is a good chance that they are looking at yours. font size it’s important to understand the social side of blogging. the social nature of blogging requires that you interact with your readers on a regular basis. you also need to make contacts that write about the same topics that you do. success won’t happen without work. the fortunes of your blog are dependent on your initiative. pay attention to the font size you choose for your blog. since written content is crucial on your blog, you need to be sure it’s font is readable. the right font size toes the fine line between being readable and being obnoxious; choose one that strikes the right balance. don’t cram your blog full to the brim with keywords. choosing keywords selectively is crucial for your blog. however, quality is much more vital than quantity. search engines are much better at separating the wheat from the chaff than they were even five years ago. when you have too many keywords on your site, search engines will flag it and your rank in the search results pages will drop because it will be clear that quality isn’t what you are concerned about. this is why you should select precise keywords that have been proven to increase your amount of traffic. commonly, ads are becoming a bigger part of blogs as people look to make money. however, you will probably have a hard time attracting readers if you have too many ads on your site. once they look at all of the ads, they will probably search for a less cluttered blog. posting videos to your site can give it a more appealing look. remember, however, that as great as videos are, solid written content is still priority number one. include text descriptions or even transcripts for every video that you post. this will help you generate key words that relate to your video, which helps people find your blog when searching the internet. think about whether or not you really need ads on your blog. advertisements are a common way for bloggers to make money. the problem with advertisements is that, well, they are advertisements. the fact that you are trying to make money becomes immediately obvious to the reader. having a lot of visual appeal in a blog can be helpful in attracting your audience. photos and colorful quotes will give readers interesting things to view. this is a great and easy way for you to get your readers more interested in your writings. make sure you incorporate visuals into your blog. graphs, photos of your family or even cartoons will increase the quality of each blog post. you will increase the interest of your readers in this manner. use backlinks effectively to increase search engine visibility and increase readers for your site. if search engines, like google, recognize your page as an authority, your website will rank higher. the more other websites and blogs link to your site, the more authoritative it will seem. this is known as back linking. be sure to get a variety of good backlinks, rather than having lots from one site. the above article offered lots of writing a blog information. if you are feeling a little overwhelmed right now, that is completely normal. even though it can be hard work, running a blog is well worth the effort. be sure to keep this article somewhere so that you’re able to use it later. trade links to build more traffic for your website over time. trade links with bloggers who have sites about relevant information or topics to yours. don’t waste your time or your readers’ time by trading links with sites that aren’t relevant to your own blog. if you focus your efforts on bringing quality traffic to your site, you will rank more highly in search engine results pages. blogger share this:click

"la información de los organismos de inteligencia de la policía nacional fue liberada, manipulada y entregada indebidamente, contraviniendo por completo los postulados de la reserva de las informaciones que tiene bajo su custodia y estudio", señalaron los magistrados. y agregan que "filtrar datos inexactos viola la libertad de prensa". la sentencia también deja en claro que no existe "reparo alguno" sobre la forma como el noticiero qap obtuvo la noticia ni como la difundió. en el proceso se encontró que los organismos de inteligencia de la policía apenas estaban recaudando información y aún no habían verificado la veracidad de los datos ni la plena identidad de los supuestos responsables del cargamento ilegal. con reservas, procurador puede conocer actas sobre demanda de nicaragua la sala de consulta del consejo de estado le dijo al gobierno que puede entregarle a la procuraduría copia de las actas de las sesiones de la comisión asesora de relaciones exteriores en las que se discutió la demanda de nicaragua sobre aguas territoriales en el caribe. esa fue la respuesta, que no obliga, a una consulta de la cancillería sobre la petición que hizo el ministerio público, que a la vez indaga eventuales responsabilida- des en la estrategia de defensa que terminó con el fallo adverso en la haya.la sala advierte que el procurador puede tener acceso a las actas, pero que está obligado a guardar la reserva sobre esos documentos. "mientras (la reserva) no sea levantada por el presidente de la república y la comisión asesora de relaciones exteriores, el procurador no las podrá revelar", dice el concepto. el artículo 4 de la ley 68 de 1993, que fue tenido en cuenta por los magistrados, señala que la comisión asesora y el presidente de la república pueden decidir el levantamiento de la reserva. redacción justicia comentar guardar ingrese o regístrese acá para guardar los artículos en su zona de usuario y leerlos cuando quiera este artículo ya fue guardado para consultarlo en otro momento, visite su zona de usuario. artículo guardado para consultarlo en otro momento, visite su zona de usuario. el artículo no pudo ser guardado, intente nuevamente reportar volver a portada sabemos que te gusta estar siempre informado. crea una cuenta y podrás disfrutar de: acceso a boletines con las mejores noticias de actualidad. comentar las noticias que te interesan. guardar tus artículos favoritos. crea una cuenta y podrás disfrutar nuestro contenido desde cualquier dispositivo. copyright © 2018 el tiempo casa editorial. prohibida su reproducción total o parcial, así como su traducción a cualquier idioma sin autorización escrita de su titular. eltiempo.com todas las noticias principales de colombia y el mundo síguenos en: 󰀰 󰀱 󰀲

__label__low the campaign for da home comment policy my burn policy 8.15.2011 random monday morning thoughts well, now i'm no so bummed about the 100 degree record falling on thursday when that fluke thunderstorm came through. saturday would have killed it any way. i don't know if much will be made of it, but the government in san francisco shutting down some cellphone towers to prevent the organization of protests should bother you greatly. cue the "what is this? communist russia?" theme. espn had a lot of little league games on this weekend. i think the kids are getting cockier with each passing year. michelle bachman wins the iowa straw poll, sarah palin shows up in iowa just to sign autographs and say "aw, shucks", and rick perry joins the race. i bet the president obama haters couldn't turn off cspan this weekend. an age that surprised me: michelle bachman is 55. that's a hot 55. an age that surprised me #2: al sharpton is 56. i would have thought he was in his 70s. did you know that a third grader is capable of telling a very long story and then, without missing a beat, tell the same very long story over again when her momma enters the room? idiocracy: there's a kids' game named "doggie doo". (thanks, thomas.) still no results in the search for the owner of the stray dog. we've put up posters as well as a listing on craig's list without luck. did i mention that he'd been neutered? and i gave him a bath this weekend. i think mrs. ll is distancing from the doggie. hey, i'm no pr expert, but if i'm a dallas cop who gets arrested outside of a strip club, i don't think i'd have a strip club picture as my facebook profile pic. you always see a pretty big turnout whenever a firefighter is killed regardless of the cause of death. (i.e. the guy that fell out of the stands at the rangers game.) it'll be interesting to see the response to the funeral of the dallas firefighter this weekend who actually died while fighting a fire. the dallas cowboys defense from last thursday night: a pic showing 14 men on the field. not much in the update today but i still get to be bothered by the death of a 32 year old from chico and a 43 year old from bridgeport. edit: motorcycle death. at 8:31 am email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest 50 comments: anonymous said... i'm glad you could get the update. i can't get it to come on my computer. just that stupid blurb about the commissioners lifting the fire ban? what were they thinking, or did one of them have to burn his trash? 8:39 am anonymous said... hollis jones? is that dq and armandos hollis jones? 8:42 am wordkyle said... regarding bachmann, straw polls, palin & perry -- how many times have you mentioned that the preseason is meaningless and boring to watch? the starters don't really play until the season is under way and some of the minor players have been cut. then there will be something worth paying attention to. 8:47 am anonymous said... the cell phone thing is not a big deal, in this instance. the rumors were that the protestors planned to basically shut down the transit system. they can protest somewhere else, no problem. would we be upset if dfw airport turned off cell tower access because a few thousand people planned to charge the runways and stop air traffic? no. 8:49 am anonymous said... as a sportswriter who has dealt with kids and their parents for nearly 25 years, don't get me started on how kids behave nowadays! more and more, kids have no respect for authority, and think they are entitled to special treatment. the only thing worse than the kids are the parents who, most of the time, are living out their own athletic dreams through their kids because they were failed athletes when they were young! 8:56 am anonymous said... king obamy's approval rating below 40% for the first time. hum, wonder why? because he isn't a leader, has no experience, doesn't have a clue what to do to fix a problem, spending out of control. i think i know why now! 8:59 am anonymous said... obama-haters watch fox news. cspan is full of left-wing bias. 9:00 am raymond said... read a book that will make you appreciate our summer of heat! 9:09 am anonymous said... the 43-year-old was a frequent jail flyer. just sayin'. 9:24 am triple fake... said... cowboys' defense lined up with 14:when you've got saint tim tebow on the opposing team, massive amounts of cussing at only 11 players just isn't enough!favorite quote from the strip club cop:"if you had a million dollor what would do" two chicks at the same time a guy with million dollor's could hook that up." office spacethe choice of quote says a lot, but the incorrect usage of grammar, spelling, and punctuation is an indictment of the education he received and what dpd is willing to accept from it. well, i for one, will not stand here and listen to you bad mouth our education system, etc...triple fake eric stratton 9:26 am anonymous said... well, 8:59, arte you saying that anyone with such low ratings is not a leader?wordkyle hinting at a major player entering the race soon? he must be in the know, whereas the rest of the country will just have to sit back and wait to be enlightened by him. i won't be holding my breath. rage 9:32 am anonymous said... i wonder what happen to the 32 year old and the 43 year old. and yes it was the same dq and armondos hollis jones. 9:32 am anonymous said... barry, you're kidding about bachmann right? i mean, hot!? come on man, she looks like a constipated, retarded, fem-bot that's been beat too much. 9:40 am anonymous said... now, now, it's not a strip club. because its website wouldn't lie:"stripper bar is not a strip joint, it's a bar and attraction, a place to enjoy the coolest drink specials in town… and the hottest… well… you know." 9:50 am anonymous said... what's not to love..? 9:55 am anonymous said... rage, i will translate for you. 8:59 is saying hobammy isn't a leader no matter what his disapproval rating is. 9:56 am anonymous said... i too wonder about the 32 yr old from chico. sad. so young. 10:01 am anonymous said... all i need to know about rick perry is he supported al gore... 10:04 am anonymous said... barry, bachmann looks good for her age, but hot is not a good word for women her age. 10:06 am anonymous said... 8:59but he must be a better leader than the previous 8 presidents that had lower ratings?3 out of 4 that fell below 30% were republicans?amazing that you can look at a table where obama has the best score if any of them and still bash away? 10:08 am anonymous said... free speech wasnt attacked. you were free to say what you wanted.. just not using a cell phone on one of those towers. sfo removed a tool used for communication. not the right to communicate. 10:22 am anonymous said... 9:40, are you saying that hillary, janet reno, madeline halfbright, nancy pelosi, eleanor roosevelt and bella abzug were beautiful women to you? 10:22 am anonymous said... the 32 year old lost a long battle with the effects of contracting lyme disease. fine young woman such a shame. heartfelt condolences to the family. 10:23 am anonymous said... 10:08, i'll bet the 20 million unemployed americans think hobammy is doing a great job, especially the way he has a laser like focus on jobs(except when he is playing golf or on vacation.) 10:29 am anonymous said... heard the 32 year old died of lyme's disease. 10:30 am the secret police said... speaking of approval, disapproval, barry, you forgot 1 little news item that's pretty important. obamacare.unconstitutional.just wanted to remind you.your welcome 10:48 am anonymous said... 8:49, that is just stupid! dfw has protests all the time against american airlines. the protesters do not charge the runways. that is just ridiculous. 10:56 am anonymous said... 10:29, i'm sure they are not any happier knowing the bush-cheney era jobs went overseas more than any other admin. 10:58 am anonymous said... 10:29, i'm sure they are not any happier knowing the bush-cheney era jobs went overseas more than any other admin. 10:58 am anonymous said... 9:32 -- yep, he can't lead. doesn't have a clue. no hard plan to get us out of it. just flaps his lips and blames others. sheesh 11:32 am anonymous said... the bulldog in the random thoughts pict is not happy to be on that beach. not by a long shot.my other brother darryl 11:59 am anonymous said... 10:58 in the bush-cheney era was the economy this bad?were 40+ million on welfare? 12:18 pm anonymous said... bush didn't send jobs overseas, start a war we had no bidness fighting or give away truckloads of bailout cash.that's just redonkulous. it's all obama's fault! 12:25 pm anonymous said... let me try and dumb this down for some of you.most american companies would not be sending jobs overseas if union thugs and it's followers wouldn't rape the american companies on pay rates. 12:27 pm anonymous said... mr, secret police,the supreme court will determine if it is unconstitutional, hasn't got there yet.just to remind you,you're welcome. 12:47 pm anonymous said... i got an email this morning from tailgate t's about the baylor/tcu tshirt i ordered. it seems the price on the website did not include shipping, and the shirts won't be ready to mail out until august 30th. argh. 12:57 pm anonymous said... 10:58moving jobs overseas started rolling when slick willie was the president. the 90's was prime time for moving i.t. jobs specifically to india. from 2000 on was just a continuation of a "good thing" as far as large companies were concerned.having spent my career in the i.t. industry, i know and have dealt with the above, for a fact, jack. 1:43 pm anonymous said... 11:59 if you know bulldogs, that little bulldog is about as happy looking as a bulldog can look. 2:24 pm anonymous said... bill clinton was the ultimate free trader. a graph of the number of manufacturing jobs going overseas explodes upward during the last year of clinton's presidency. the policy that he laid down is the reason for continued number of jobs being exported in the coming years and the continued upward slope of the graph. even clinton's wife thinks he is wrong on this one.you anti american labor might want to look at the situation a little different. the assembly of my truck was done in mexico city. the worker there paid no income tax to the u.s. neither did the unemployed auto worker in detroit pay any income tax to the u.s. instead he has been on the receiving end from the government since his job was send down south. because of so many manufacturing jobs are going to mexico, china, etc. we have a lot of unemployed people that are receiving food stamps, housing, etc. from government agencies. and where does obama get the money to pay to the unemployed. answer is that he borrows it from china. this is real stupid. real, real stupid. all of the unemployment benefits come from taxes. are you anti union people paying taxes? would you rather pay taxes so the u.s. can pay the interest on debt owed by you and your children to china? or would you pay a little more for products made in america by americans who pay income taxes? assemble my next truck in the u.s. and a currently uemployed auto worker will have a job and be paying income tax instead of receiving tax dollars in the form of housing, food stamps, etc. 2:40 pm anonymous said... i wish hillary was president. we would not be in this budget crunch. 3:29 pm anonymous said... assemble my next truck in the u.s. the onus is on your to buy american-made, sweet tits. not the other way around.rage 3:32 pm anonymous said... just returned from san francisco and i saw plenty of people using cell phones. ??? 4:13 pm anonymous said... rage, i just fainted at the thought of hobammy as president for another four years. 4:15 pm anonymous said... is that cop a hero now, let me get this straight fire fighter dies doing his job that he applied for and gets paid for, cue the eagle whistle, lee greenwood hits the stage and the brushpopper shirt wearing crowds puts another sticker on there car. so the guy that fell off the billboard doing his job, is he a hero 5:18 pm anonymous said... rage, please use words that are found in the dictionary. and please write complete sentences with proper sentence structure so i can understand the point you are trying to make. 5:31 pm anonymous said... 2:40,"would you rather pay taxes so the u.s. can pay the interest on debt owed by you and your children to china? or would you pay a little more for products made in america by americans who pay income taxes?"not the only two options. i would rather buy an american made vehicle, where the workers made a reasonable wage, without outlandish benefits.in other words, a car made in a right-to-work state. plenty of them.unions have killed the us economy, along with brother obama.henry ford 7:11 pm anonymous said... one4three, why did not dooby stop it then? after 2000? slick gets all the blame? 7:51 pm anonymous said... 12:27american comapnies will stop sending jobs overseas when american workers will be willing to work for eighty cents an hour and work 12 hour days without overtime pay. 9:18 pm anonymous said... unions have grown the middle class....greed has shrunk it. 2:57 am crap o'meter said... good gawd tator skins! clueless alert at 9:18! you know good and well that is a flat out want to be falsification right there!you just go on believing crap like that. believing crap is what got us that so called potus in the office right now.wake up o’clueless one. 12:48 pm post a comment newer post older post home subscribe to: post comments (atom) critical links wise county on the

(it's a lot like fread) it internally cached the file for speed, for instance, if it's actually in a compressed zip and you are asking for one byte at a time it will really be decoding in 4 kb chunks behind the scenes mounting a .zip as a filesystem this happens automatically when you are doing an android target, so you can load resources by filename and not worry about where they actually are. (android wants to keep them in your .apk you used to install) but you may want to mount your own zips for some reason. let's examine how it's done: filesystemzip *pfilesystem = new filesystemzip(); pfilesystem->init("somezip.file")); //i'm not doing error handling in these examples, but it would return false on error //to print out the entire contents of the zip: vector contents = pfilesystem->getcontents(); for (int i=0; i setrootdirectory("assets"); //mount the assets directory only, the user won't have to have "assets" in the filename to find things in it //to actually mount it getfilemanager()->mountfilesystem(pfilesystem); //test that it worked: fileinstance myfile("textfileinsideassetsdirofthezip.txt"); if (myfile.isloaded()) logmsg("marty, it worked!"); what about writing user data files? i just use fwrite and fread and haven't have any trouble with porting so far. as long as you use getsavepath() you're ok as far as file permissions go. proton/filemanager.txt · last modified: 2012/03/09 01:05 by seth page tools show pagesourceold revisionsbacklinksback to top except where otherwise noted, content on this wiki is licensed under the following license: cc attribution-share alike 4.0 international

__label__low whatbreesees skip to content homebree upcoming shows past shows venues my jams friends with blogs tag archives: justin vernon december 26, 2017 · 9:16 pm bon iver friday, december 8, 2017 state theatre, portland, maine in a sentence–for me, sadly, this show was a surprising disappointment. i saw bon iver for the first time in september of 2012 at the bank of america pavillion in boston. caroline and i went together, and she wrote a lovely guest post giving the show a five star rating. i was in the third or fourth row for that full band show, and i was over the moon to hear some of my bon iver favorites in person and to sing “the wolves (acts i and ii)” together. the energy at that show was palpably positive. when i saw that bon iver was playing so nearby in portland at state theatre, i was thrilled. i set an alarm to buy tickets in the presale, but the timing of my teaching plans were a little off because we had an unexpected fire drill, so i selfishly asked my students to work on their homework for a few minutes while i tried to get tickets on both my laptop and my phone. my phone came through for me and i snagged a pair of tickets a few rows from the back of the room, and i can’t think of a time i was so happy to have basically back row seats. i checked again when tickets went on sale to the general public, but they seemed completely sold out right away. i read through more than a hundred comments from angry bon iver fans about how impossible it was to get tickets for the show, and revelled in my luck. i even looked online at stubhub just to see if i could get seats closer to the stage, but seats in my far away section were selling for $250 each (a huge markup over the $65 face value). i scoffed at the idea of selling my tickets for profit anyhow, but then i went to the show and thought twice. bartlett was my lucky date for the night, even though many people inquired about my extra ticket for the show right up until the night of the show. we met for dinner at el rayo, had a couple of tacos and cocktails, and made our way to state theatreearly to make it through their added security and because there was no opening act. justin vernon took the stage solo, which i am usually totally in favor of, but this was an odd night. i was surprised by how many people were back and forth to the bar and bathroom during the show because we’d all paid a decent amount for these highly sought after tickets and i figured everyone there would be a big fan. (a sarcastic shout out to the annoying super fan couple in the third row that spent most of the night dancing wildly on your feet–rudely obstructing the views of and distracting everyone all around you. you guys made me glad my seats were so far away). there was some sort of chatter coming from the other front orchestra section, i guess, because justin interjected a snarky comment about them, and then followed up with a comment about how we should all just love each other. later, someone from the crowd shouted out “i love you, justin,” and he responded “i have plans later. but i appreciate that.” i thought some (but not all) of his banter with the audience was awkward to the point of kind of mean spirited. it felt like he didn’t want to have to perform for us, and it ruined the show experience for me. my view of justin vernon from the back of the state theatre i didn’t feel at all this way five years ago when i first saw bon iver live, so i have some theories about this night’s cringeworthy moments. the easiest explanation would be that folks nearest him were being rude and i couldn’t hear it. that, sadly, has been the case at other shows i’ve been to in portland, where people talk all night over the performer. regina spektor’s show earlier this year at state theatrecomes right to mind. maybe something has shifted for justin during these years that makes performing difficult for him, or, he was just having a bad night. if i missed something, please tell me. i’d love to know there was an obvious cause for his somewhat grumpy demeanor. musically, justin was great. i loved hearing so many songs i love live–“flume,”“perth,”“blood bank,”“skinny love,”and “woods”–and his cover of“i can’t make you love me”was heart wrenching, as expected. i enjoyed hearing the heavily electronic songs from his 2016 album, 22, a million in person, too. it felt good to sing “the wolves (acts i and ii)” together to end the night at justin’s invitation, but i was very surprised he only played a one song encore (a cover of mahalia jackson’s “satisfied mind”), because he was on stage less than an hour. i’d felt so lucky to have the opportunity to be in the room, but was genuinely sadly disappointed during and after the show. it felt like an off night from start to finish, and it seemed to me like justin struggles with the pressures of being a beloved musician, which seemed to shine through during this show. in the end, i am fine with having spent $65 to see justin vernon from basically the back row, but i probably wouldn’t do it again, which is disappointing given how much his music has positively impacted my life. if you missed this show, i honestly don’t think you missed much. maybe something was going on with the crowd up front that i couldn’t hear. if folks were being rude and justin was annoyed with them–i can totally live with that. from where i sat, though, this show was a bummer. if you saw another night of this tour and had a very positive experience, i would also like to hear from you so that i know this was simply an off night and that justin is just fine. i’m truly hoping for that. xo, bree advertisements leave a comment filed under

__label__low see all stores cars for sale sell your car financing articles 7 best small trucks for 2018 best-selling cars 7 best small trucks for 2018 published friday, april 13, 2018 01 the right combination of ruggedness and style. a pickup truck is a practical vehicle option for many drivers. at the same time, larger pickup trucks can sometimes be a little "over-the-top" for basic hauling, towing, and cargo needs. this is where shopping for small pickup trucks can be a wise option. with a smaller sized or midsize pickup truck, you can still enjoy substantial towing capacity and cargo storage—along with greater fuel economy and maneuverability in even the smallest of urban spaces. in many ways, small pickup trucks offer the best of both worlds! looking for some help in narrowing down your options when it comes to a small truck purchase? we've already taken care of some of the research for you. this list of seven top small trucks was developed based on vehicle type and carmax sales data from september 29, 2017 through march 29, 2018. here are our findings: ford explorer sport trac honda ridgeline ford ranger gmc canyon chevrolet colorado nissan frontier toyota tacoma 07 ford explorer sport trac first created in 2001 as an offshoot of the popular ford explorer suv, the ford explorer sport trac is similar in body style to the explorer suv with the addition of a small pickup bed in the back. and while this particular vehicle was only manufactured until 2010 (with a year off in 2006), it reached peak popularity in the small truck market due to its innovation (especially for its time) and functionality. if you're feeling a little torn between an suv and a pickup truck for your next vehicle, the sport trac might be a good compromise for you. and despite the fact that it hasn't been in production in awhile, you can generally still find used sport tracs on the market, particularly in the 2007 through 2010 model years. 06 honda ridgeline if you're intrigued by the idea of an suv/pickup crossover but are looking for something with more recent production, the honda ridgeline is definitely worth a test drive. the 2017 version of this vehicle boasts a unique two-way tailgate that is even wider and longer than that of most midsize pickup trucks. it also comes standard with a powerful 3.5 liter v6 engine, though upgraded engine options are available as you move up in trim level. speaking of trim options, the 2017 ridgeline is available in an impressive range of seven trims, including the base rt, sport, rtl-e, and premium black edition. standard features across all trim levels include a rearview camera, tow hitch, and 18-inch wheels. 05 ford ranger originally manufactured from 1983 through 2011, the ford ranger consistently topped lists for best-selling small pickup trucks. in 2019, ford will bring back the ranger with a brand new redesign that many are eagerly anticipating. in the meantime, you can still find used ford rangers on the market, such as the popular 2011 ranger. this small pickup truck is available in both a regular and extended cab, known as the supercab, for additional passenger leg room. the 2011 ranger also comes in both a six-foot and seven-foot bed option to suit your hauling needs, and is available in three trim levels: the xl, xlt, and sport. a 2.3 liter, 143-horsepower engine comes standard, though an upgraded v6 is an option on the xlt and sport trims. 04 gmc canyon looking for a pickup truck with a little more cabin space than some of these smaller pickups on the market? if so, then the gmc canyon is a great midsize pickup option worth your consideration. the 2017 version of this truck is available in your choice of two-, four-, or -five-seater options, as well as two different bed lengths and five trim options to choose from: the base sl, canyon, sle, slt, and premium denali. standard features across all trim levels include a 2.5 liter, four cylinder engine, rearview camera, and 4.2-inch color display. and in its upgraded v6 engine, you'll enjoy a maximum towing capacity of 7,000 pounds (versus 3,500 pounds with the standard engine). 03 chevrolet colorado another excellent midsize pickup truck to consider is the chevrolet colorado. this truck has been one of the best-selling pickups on the market for many years, and for good reason. the 2017 colorado boasts impressive maneuverability and handling, especially when compared to its full-size counterpart (the silverado). it is also available with a wide range of customization options that buyers will love, including three engine choices, several different bed configurations, two bed lengths, and a whopping five trim levels. in the base trim, drivers will enjoy an extended cab, rearview camera, and 2.5 liter engine. upgrade to the lt trim, however, and you'll also enjoy an available 4g wi-fi hot spot! 02 nissan frontier when it comes to midsize pickup trucks that are both practical and affordable, the nissan frontier is a strong contender. while it may not be loaded with standard features, the 2017 frontier is a rugged work truck that will serve many drivers well. offered in both a crew cab and extended cab, as well as a 5-foot or 6.1-foot bed length, this frontier comes in your choice of five trim levels. standard on the base s trim are rear privacy glass, bluetooth® connectivity, and 15-inch wheels. in order to upgrade from the base four cylinder engine (and 3,500-pound towing capacity, when properly equipped1), however, you'll need to select the sv or higher trim (which comes with a v6 capable of towing nearly double that when the vehicle is properly equipped). 01 toyota tacoma topping our list of best small pickup trucks is the toyota tacoma. looking at the 2017 tacoma, drivers love its high profile and abundant standard features, which include a durable composite bed (no liner needed!), a backup camera, and even a built-in gopro® mount on the windshield for easy recording. these ample features, combined with its towing capacity of nearly 7,000 pounds (when properly equipped1) and incredibly smooth ride, make the tacoma a top-seller in smaller pickups. false true new arrival shop used small trucks near you start your search 4294963181+4294962747+4294963153+4294963146+4294963136+4294962675+4294962962+4294963103+4294962865+4294963090+4294962945+4294962979+4294962861 250 whether you're looking for a bare-bones work truck or something loaded with features, one of these small trucks is sure to appeal to you! now, browse carmax to find your top picks for sale near you and start scheduling some test drives! while you're at it, check out these related carmax articles during your search: best pickup trucks of 2017 which to buy: toyota tundra vs. toyota tacoma 1various factors may impact towing capacity, including weight of passengers, cargo, and options/accessories. unless otherwise noted, information related to these featured vehicles comes from third-party sources, including manufacturer information. product and company names may be trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of third-party entities. use of them does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by these entities. related topics chevrolet frontier ford gmc honda nissan pickup-trucks best-cars ridgeline ranger toyota tacoma canyon colorado explorer-sport-trac related articles best-selling cars 85 best ranked used cars for 2018 what is the right car for you to buy in 2018?

__label__low mumblings from 203cm above earth this is the blog of steve davis. that is all. tuesday, january 24, 2006 much better day today was a much better day overall with much lower levels of anxiety and depression. i had a call back from the nlp practitioner and will arrange to do a course of 5 evening sessions with her at the end of february. she's convinced that nlp will definately help. i have to admit to being a little sceptical but will give anything a go. oh my god! i decided to try something different at the gym today and had a go at a body combat class. i'm not sure what i was expecting, perhaps a cross between martial arts and music but it was way more intense than anything i could have prepared for. it combined a very high energy dance workout with martial arts and combat moves, punches and kicks. it uses a completely different set of muscles than spinning and highlighted to me how little co-ordination i have. it took a little while to get into the flow and more often than not i was completely out of sync with everyone else but after about 20 minutes i got into the flow. i'll definately give it another go. i think i'm going to feel it tomorrow though :-) posted by steve at 21:29 no comments: post a comment newer post older post home subscribe to: post comments (atom) 1000 miles in 2012 this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution-noncommercial-no derivative works 3.0 license. my links garans blog my ebay auctions my flickr photos www.flickr.com this is a flickr badge showing public photos from stevedavis. make your own badge here. post labels blog car comments computers diet entertainment fun motorbike personal photos rants reviews travel work blog archive ► 2012 (4) ► april (1) ► january (3) ► 2010 (3) ► june (1) ► may (2) ► 2009 (14) ► december (1) ► november (1) ► september (1) ► june (2) ► march (1) ► february (3) ► january (5) ► 2008 (90) ► december (4) ► november (3) ► october (9) ► september (10) ► august (6) ► july (14) ► june (6) ► may (16) ► april (6) ► march (9) ► february (3) ► january (4) ► 2007 (58) ► december (2) ► november (4) ► october (2) ► september (10) ► august (4) ► july (6) ► june (2) ► may (6) ► april (3) ► march (12) ► february (4) ► january (3) ▼ 2006 (62) ► december (3) ► november (2) ► october (2) ► september (1) ► august (5) ► july (4) ► june (5) ► may (5) ► april (5) ► march (10) ► february (5) ▼ january (15) at last! put into perspective what's hot on the 'net? much better day tough day a useful resource a bit of exercise coping with depression lets get this party started cool christmas do bite size me! making a start back to work already ! pop! happy new year!! ► 2005 (133) ► december (8) ► november (4) ► october (4) ► september (4) ► august (13) ► july (9) ► june (20) ► may (15) ► april (14) ► march (9) ► february (13) ► january (20) ► 2004 (162) ► december (12) ► november (9) ► october (15) ► september (17) ► august (16) ► july (36) ► june (19) ► may (38) rss syndication awesome inc. theme. theme images by follow777. powered by blogger.

__label__low nya besked 14 augusti 2016 | 20:04 i torsdags ringde onkologläkaren upp mig efter att sahlgrenska tittat på mina röntgen plåtar. dom läkarna rekommendera att jag skulle äta cellgifter i 3 omgångar till då de hade sett någon tillväxt. först kändes det som ett jävla bakslag men sedan efter att ha pratat med jonas och diskuterat med läkaren så känns det "skönt" att de såg detta nu istället för om 3 månader då jag ska göra ny mr-röntgen, för tänk om det hade växt ännu mera så jag även fått börja med strålning igen. i fredags var det kräftfiskepremiär. alltid lika mysigt. barnen helt lyriska. och vi fick helt ok med kräftor oxå. permalink | kommentarer (1) | trackbacks bra besked 😃 05 augusti 2016 | 21:02 oj shit vad fort sommaren har gått. små grabbarna har haft sommarlov i 6 veckor. på måndag börjar de igen. joel börjar fritids, algot ny avdelning och även mårten ny avdelning. vi har haft en lugn och skön semester ihop men det ska bli skönt med rutiner igen. mårten och joel började med 2 veckors simskola. inte i det bästa vädret men de kämpade på riktigt bra. mårten knäckte koden och kan nu simma, joel är på god väg. sedan åkte vi ner en sväng till mammas och pappas stuga i olofsbo. jag stannade 2 nätter medan barnen och jonas 4 nätter.givetvis fiskades det krabbor 😊😊☺ 💙💙💙vi tog oss en tur till torp stenhus och medeltidsdagar. pilbågsskytte testades och så tittade vi på slaget sverige mot danmark. vi har oxå varit på high chaparrel. så kul och barnen var lyriska över alltcooling algot 😉en rädd algot när vi blir "rånade" på tåget.vi har även varit ute och åkt med våra båt. vi försökte även fiska men det gav ingen lycka tyvärr för några veckor sedan så anordnade några föreningar här fritsladagen. en mysig dag som erbjöd bla ansiktsmålning, musik quiz, uppträdande, fotbollsmatch lag öst mot väst, fritsla triahtlon där jonas ställde upp och det gick bra för honom. sedan på kvällen var det fest i viljans park 😃de två minsta efter fritsla dagen 😊😊i torsdags var vi i göteborg med farmor och farfar och turistade. åkte paddan, hop on- hop off buss m.malgot var lite trött så han somnade gott på bussen en sväng 😂😂och så till det bästa. gjorde en mr-röntgen förra måndagen. nu har jag strålats färdigt och fått sista kuren cellgifter. och mr visade att tumören inte har växt, utan är oförändrad 😃😆😃😆 jag har fortfarande en hel del ont och det är strålningskador. nu är planen att avsluta cortison och morfin. permalink | kommentarer (5) | trackbacks en tuff dag 01 juni 2016 | 22:50 idag har jag varit på begravning 😢 min kusin endast 24år. så sorligt och ledsamt men hon var sjuk. hon mår bättre nu! givetvis kom det funderingar på hur jag vill ha min begravning. får sätta mig ner och skriva upp det. på ett vis vill jag inte ha några blommor, för kan jag inte få dom idag när jag lever varför ska jag då "få" dom när jag inte lever. fast så kan man ju vända på det....varför inte "få" blommor då.två av alla fina blomsrerarrangemang. permalink | kommentarer (1) | trackbacks dålig... 25 maj 2016 | 17:51 uppdatering. vet inte riktigt vad jag ska skriva.allt rullar på här. i fredagskväll avslutade jag min 4:e behandling av 6 av cellgifter.jag har en del ont till och från. äter morfin och cortison dagligen och även ep medicin. benplattan kommer de operera in när jag ätit klart cellgifterna, så någon gång i höst. på dagarna gör jag lite allt möjligt. träffar någon eller bara är hemma. förra helgen var hela våran familj, mamma, pappa, lillebror och min storebror och hans familj på kolmården och firade mamma som fyllt år och pappa som fyller år. mysiga dagar verkligen. dock var inte våra barn så "jättenoga" med att titta på djuren (kan vara så att vi har varit mycket på borås djurpark.) men något vi alla gilla var delfinshowen kort på en liten goding!kusinerna som är så goa mot varandra ❤ permalink | kommentarer (2) | trackbacks trött och orkeslös 07 mars 2016 | 16:40 vi var ju som sagt och träffade en kurator för att få mera tips på hur vi ska berätta för barnen. hon tyckte att vi kunde säga att jag ska dö men på ett "inlindat" sätt. vi har inte berättat något än. vi tänkte vi skulle gjort det nu i helgen men sjukdom bland barnen satte stopp för det. så vi får se när vi gör det. lite innebandy spel ute i lera funkar fin fint 😃jonas bror peter och hans tjej har "fått" 3 ursöta kalvar som vi var och hälsade på för några veckor sedan och en var kaxig så att barnen kunde klapp den, men mamman övervaka noga. kolla in våran coola elefantsnigel som vi har i vårat akvarie 😍räkan kolla in utsikten från draken 😂😂själv mår jag så där. trött, orkeslös och ont. vissa dagar bättre vissa sämre. ❤❤ så är det ❤❤ permalink | kommentarer (8) | trackbacks alla hjärtansdag 14 februari 2016 | 20:13 det var ett tag sedan nu jag skrev här. orken och lusten har inte funnits. här kommer en liten uppdatering. jag har strålats färdigt och även ätit en omgång cellgifter. har nu haft paus från "allt" men ska imorgon börja med cellgifter igen och då i högre dos i 5 dagar sedan paus i 3 veckor för att sedan äta 5 dagar paus i 3 veckor och så ska jag göra i 6 månader. jag har fått tillbaka en ny tumör men den hade minskat under strålningen. i maj ska jag göra ny mr-röntgen så då får vi se hur den ser "ut" men så länge jag mår "bra" så kommer det inte att göras något. dock har jag till och från en heldel ont så jag får ta morfin. känner att mitt tålamod är bättre oxå. när jag precis kommit hem så var mitt tålamod så dåligt, kunde bli arg på minsta grej. dock det här med ljud är något som är jobbigt, speciellt plötsliga höga ljud.något som är j*vligt jobbigt är oxå att vi ska berätta för barnen att jag ska dö. dock ska vi inte säga just att jag ska dö utan något "annat" typ att jag ska bli en stjärna eller ängel. vi (jag & jonas) ska till en kurator på tisdag och få hjälp med hur vi ska säga m.m) vill inte säga något, vi vet ju inte när jag kommer att göra det. fan fan fan vad jag vill skydda dom från det. permalink | kommentarer (14) | trackbacks dagen för dopparedagen 21 december 2015 | 19:47 ja då var det julafton imorgon. vart tog denna hösten vägen? iår åker vi först till mina föräldrar och firar jul sedan åker vi till jonas föräldrar och firar där på kvällen 🎄🎅 vi har firat jul hos mina föräldrar alla de senaste åren, men i år togs beslutet att vi skulle dela upp det och det är bra för min del då jag inte orkar så mycket tjo och tjim. barnen pyntade sin gran häromdagen de var helt lyriska och så nöjda 😃😃algot pyntade inget men låg och tittade från våran säng hur bröderna skötte sig. (han hade feber) vi var ute i skogen i söndags och letade upp våran gran. gick förvånansvärt smidigt iår 😀mina grabbar ❤❤❤❤och jag (nissarna) pyntade våran igår kväll 😊 japp ser att toppen är sne får fixa det. annars rullar allt på här. jag åker till strålningen varje dag. här är bara lite av det jag har tappat. så fort jag rör håret på höger sida så ramlar det av hår.nu har jag börjat bli skalle per, så i måndags var jag och tittade ut peruk, kan säga att det inte var/är det lättaste ska dit igen nästa vecka så får vi se vad det blir för någon. vill ha så likt mitt nuvarande hår som möjligt. måste visa mina fina naglar som sabina fixat åt mig. så nöjd. lagom längd och lite glitter men inte för mycket 😃nu ska jag stänga mina blå en sväng. familjen är iväg och fixar det sista tills imorgon. ha en riktigt bra jul och ta vara på varandra och njut!!!kram ❤ permalink | kommentarer (10) | trackbacks trött, trött 13 december 2015 | 16:05 har märkt att några av er saknar mina inlägg. vad glad jag blir 😃ja här rullar det på, har börjat med strålbehandling och cellgifter sedan 1 och 1 halv vecka sedan. åker till borås varje dag utom helgerna och strålas men cellgifterna tar jag i tablett hemma. strålningen känns inget, får lägga mig på en brits och så sätter dom på mig min mask och den knäpper dom fast i britsen.det gör så att jag inte kan röra mig något men jag har inte ont av det och skulle jag behöva hjälp så vinkar jag med handen så kommer dom direkt. jag mår så där...har mått tok illa och kräkts framförallt på natten och förmiddagen. var hos läkaren i torsdags så nu har jag börjat med cortison igen så nu hoppas jag att illamåendet håller sig borta. jag är oxå helt sjukt trött på förmiddagarna, jag kommer verkligen inte upp ur sängen. det är så jobbigt och jag blir så arg, ledsen på mig själv men kroppen orkar verkligen inte :-( som idag när jag skulle bli hämtad av vännen stina för att jag skulle följa med och titta när mitt gudbarn lilly skulle ha show i konståkning. men jag kom inte upp så stina fick åka utan mig 😢 men vad ska jag göra??? efter mycket om och men så kom jag ut till familjen som hade varit ute och grejat och tänt brasa så vi kunde grilla korv sedan gick jag bara mest omkring här ute. nu har jag gått och lagt mig så snart ska här sovas och hoppas på att vara piggare imorgon. natti alla permalink | kommentarer (11) | trackbacks förlåt 24 november 2015 | 22:03 nu har det gått ett bra tag sedan jag skrev och nej det beror inte på att jag är sjuk denna gången. jag har helt enkelt inte orkat. här rullar dagarna på. var på onkologen i torsdags och fick besked att jag ska börja strålbehandlingen nästa onsdag så idag har jag varit och gjort en ct-röntgen och imorgon ska jag göra en mr-röntgen, detta är inga röntgen som jag får svar på utan de kollar hur de ska ställa in maskinen (vad jag har förstått) tack alla ni som har hälsat på mig och skickat meddelande m.m det betyder så mycket 💟i fredags var vi hos martin, linda, vincent och lilla valter på tacosmys. grabbarna fick bada med martin och deras pappa. jag och linda passade på att bara sitta och tjöta.på väg hem i mörkret. i lördags kom min kusin veronica på besök så lyxigt hon fixa lunch till oss 😃 och även efterrätt hade hon med sig, goa frukter. pappan i huset var iväg på tipsavslutning i smeatorpet. bastning, fotboll och mat. på söndagen var joel bjuden på kalas inne på leos leksand medans han härjade där så tog jag och pappan och skulle köpa grejer till våra garderober i hallen + kolla efter julklappar men det orkade jag inte. mårten hade sovit hos mormor och morfar och algot hos farmor och farfar så det var lyxigt att gå själva. efter stan så blev vi bjudna på lutfisk hos mamma och pappa mums..tack 💞 nej nu måste jag sova klockan ringer vid 05.00 imorgon. natti permalink | kommentarer (7) | trackbacks fika drottning 17 november 2015 | 20:49 igår var petra snäll och körde ner mig till apoteket så jag kunde hämta ut min cellgift medicin...den kostade "bara" 20 000kr för 20 tabletter. för några veckor sedan hämtade jag ut antibiotika som "bara" kostade ca 22 000kr, vad ska man säga...tur man bor i sverige och att vi har högkostnadsskyddet 😃 köpte med oss räksmörgås hem till lunch. tack sågliden för den fina blomman jag fick av er 💗på em åkte vi på utvecklingssamtal för mårten, fick höra att han är en go kille mot sina kompisar och rättvis. han är duktig och att stå längst fram och prata inför klassen har han inga problem med (har han nog ärvt från mig 😉)*stolta föräldrar*igår kväll kom lillebror och hängde med oss 💕 vi låg i varsin soffa och inte gjorde något efter middagen. joel har börjat skriva, han säger vad man ska skriva och sedan skriver han av det. våran duktiga joel 💗idag kom linda g och valter på fika. mysig stund. direkt efter dom kom svärmor ännu en mysig stund och hon han knappt åka innan pappa ringde och fråga om jag bjöd på kaffe för han hade köpt lussekatter. behöver jag säga att lunchen hoppades över. jaja så är det ibland. ikväll har jag gjort några armband jag har fått så många beställningar så om det dröjer med just ditt armband så vet du varför. nu ska jag kolla fotboll innan jag sover. glöm inte att ta hand om er, lev i nuet! ❤ permalink | kommentarer (2) | trackbacks söndag 15 november 2015 | 19:06 vilken frukost jag kom ner till idag, tomtegröt och julskinka 😍 efter frukost kaffe med fina vännen helena. sedan har jag städat av lite, skulle behövas mera men det hinns med och det som inte hinns med det skippar vi. detta är något jag har tänkt att göra länge, varför ska det ta så lång tid att göra vissa grejer så går det fort när man väl gör det. ikväll har jag kollat bron, en bra serie som idag slutade spännande, nu är det bara två avsnitt kvar. finaste lyktorna har jag haft tänt ikväll, har det ioch för sig nästan varje kväll. permalink | kommentarer (2) | trackbacks ljuslyktans sken 14 november 2015 | 22:18 morgonen började segt för mig idag. hade sovit dåligt. men

21:29 ringde ner idag till vårdcentralen och sa att jag behövde en tid till att vaccinera mig. först sa hon att man inte kan beställa tid för vaccination utan komma på de bestämda tiderna. förklarade då att jag inte kan stå i kö och vara bland massa folk pga att jag har opererat bort en hjärntumör så jag fick en tid. efteråt så åkte jag till lycke en sväng och sa tjena, gud vad jag saknar jobbet. efter en stund där blev jag akut trött så en kollega körde hem mig. det är något som jag har märkt efter operationen är att jag när jag blir trött så blir jag akut trött och måste bara komma hem om jag är borta så i em så har jag vilat. denna underbara "korg" fick jag av fritsla if's styrelse. tack snälla 💖 ikväll hade vi verkligen fredagsmys 😍gud vad gott det var...algot kämpar med en krabbklo

inte bättre än att dricka te då. det ser inte mö ut men fasiken vad det kliar, äter allergimedicin och det lindrar det en hel del. när familjen var på ingång så fixade jag till lite mat, inget avancerat men gott. vanlig potatis och sötpotatis i ugnen, stekt kycklingfile med en sås gjort på yoghurt, vitlök, salt, paprikapulver och peppar (skulle även varit spiskummin men det hade vi inte) några armband pärlade jag oxå. så kul att ni är så många som har beställt. tack 😍idag kom min kusin och han lilla dotter natalie hit. en mysig stund med lek, fika och mat. idag skulle jag tagit

29 декабря 2017 в спортивная аналитика и новости спорта: статистика матчей и прогнозы декабрь 27, 2017 0 41 просмотров дата игры 29.12.2017 начало через 1 дн 23 ч 30 мин 1дн 23:30 г 29 декабря 2017 года в 20:00 по московскому времени в рамках 15-го тура регулярного сезона мужской баскетбольной евролиги подмосковные «химки» примут каталонскую «барселону». химки «химки», как для середняка европейского баскетбола, вполне сносно проводит евросезон, как раз замыкая топ-8 и претендуя на плэй-офф, правда, та же «баскония» позади всего в одной победе. подмосковная команда далека от своих лучших кондиций, выиграв только в пяти матчах из последних 13-ти. а вот на своей арене «химки» оказывались победителями в 3-х последних случаях. конкретно в евролиге дома они выиграли в 6-ти матчах из 7-ми. во внутреннем первенстве «химки» идут 5-ми, выиграв в 5-ти матчах из 8-ми, что позволяет чувствовать себя спокойно, ведь 9-й «енисей» они уже опережают на 3 виктории. в последнем своём матче «химки» в гостях в рамках евролиги проиграли цска – 79:68. уступая в 17 пунктов походу матча, гости сокращали счёт до всего «-1», но на большее их не хватило. барселона у каталонцев дела намного хуже – они выиграли всего 4 матча из 14-ти возможных, уже на 4 виктории отставая от топ-8. команда находится в глубоком кризисе, проиграв последние 6 матчей кряду. а на выезде победили только в 4-х матчах из последних 13-ти. в национальном чемпионате дела у них идут получше – промежуточное 4-е место и фора в 2 победы над 9-й командой пока позволяют им чувствовать себя уверенно. в последнем своём матче в рамках евролиги они проиграли в гостях «басконии» — 85:82. к концу 3-й четверти гости проигрывали 21 очко, но менее чем за минуту до конца матча даже вышли на 1 пункт вперёд, но сил отстоять преимущество им не хватило. химки — барселона: статистика личных встреч команды играли друг с другом 4 раза, выиграв каждая по два раза у себя на площадке. причём оба раза победы были разгромными в прошлом сезоне – 75:61 –в химках и 87:70 – в каталонии. котировки букмекерских контор бк «пари матч» фаворитом матча считает «химки», на победу которых можно поставить с коэффициентом 1,54 против 15,4 на ничью и 2,74 – на победу «барселоны». основная фора измеряется 4,5 очками, а тотал насчитывает 161,5 пункт. прогноз и ставка от betonmobile.ru «химки» играют лучше, особенно на своём паркете. у «барселоны» очень плохая форма и неудачная серия, более того, эта команда исторически плохо играет с «химками» на выезде и наверняка уже собирается сосредоточиться на выступлениях в чемпионате испании. победа «химок» с форой (-4,5 очка) за 1,92 подробности на: betonmobile.ru 2017-12-27 novostivse предыдущий цымбалюк-романовская хочет помириться с джигарханяном следующий прогноз и ставка на

__label__low recent entries friends archive profile add to friends rss green_life зеленые решения для всей семьи. green life биткоин "зеленее", чем вы думали green_lifedecember 11th, 2017сегодня мир словно помешался на криповалютах и на их майнинге. но в свою очередь «зеленые», на фоне криптолихорадки, озабочены вопросами экологии, ведь всем известно, что один только майнинг биткоина расходует такое количество электроэнергии, которое превышает потребление целых государств, например, ирландии, дании или японии.однако, bloomberg считает, что ситуация с огромным расходом электроэнергии несколько надуманна. и вместо того, чтобы беспокоиться о том, как скоро биткоин растопит полярные ледяные шапки, стоит подумать, сколько энергии может быть спасено.прежде чем рассказать, что же имел ввиду в своей статье «блумберг», давайте разберемся, как же происходит майнинг и почему он требует столько электроэнергии. цифровая валюта на самом деле вещь весьма расточительная. биткоин-майнеры, которые обрабатывают транзакции в обмен на криптовалюту, становятся участниками большой гонки, в которой решаются чрезвычайно сложные криптографические головоломки. это вычислительное бремя помогает сохранить безопасность транзакций – превратив в непосильную задачу их подделку, - но этот процесс также требует от майнеров строительства гигантских «ферм» с серверами, которые потребляют огромное количество энергии. чем более ценным становится биткоин, тем больше майнеров готово тратить деньги на оборудование и электричество.и вот на какую мысль наталкивает нас «блумберг»: он пишет о том, что на многие вещи, в том числе и на биткоин стоит смотреть в перспективе. недавний отчет показывает, при текущих ценах майнинговые фермы «добывающие» bitcoin будут потреблять приблизительно 8,27 тераватт-часов в год. эта цифра может показаться огромной, но на самом деле это гораздо меньше, чем используют центры обработки данных в сша, и только около 0,21 процента от общего потребления электроэнергии в штатах. сам же биткоин выгодно отличается от других валют и товаров, и даже может помочь заменить некоторые из них: мировое производство наличных денег и монет потребляет около 11 тераватт-часов в год, в то время как добыча золота сжигает эквивалент 132 тераватт-часов. и эти цифры не включают в себя производство и использование бронированных грузовиков, банковских хранилищ, систем безопасности и тому подобное. поэтому в правильном контексте биткоин можно назвать «зеленым».более того потребление электроэнергии для майнинга биткоина не обязательно будет расти, как сейчас. например, уже сегодня дата-центры, где и располагаются майнинговые мощности, стали намного лучше. недавно министерство энергетики сша предсказывало, что потребление ими электроэнергии будет удваиваться каждые пять лет. но, в последние годы, общее потребление электроэнергии дата-центрами наоборот стало уменьшаться даже несмотря на то, что число майнинговых ферм и, соответственно, появление таких центров продолжало расти. как оказалось, улучшенная технология охлаждения и управления питанием повысила эффективность. биткоин-майнеры не менее мотивированы экономить, поэтому совершенно очевидно, что они будут стремиться стать более эффективными и использовать самую дешевую и доступную энергию, которую обычно дают гидроэлектростанции и другие возобновляемые источники энергии.легко критиковать биткоин за то, что он расточительно использует электроэнергию. но в жизни так много вещей, включая самолеты, поездки на работу и в другие страны, которые забирают энергию в гораздо больших масштабах, мы просто об этом не задумываемся, привыкнув критиковать все новое. биткоин как криптовалюта на самом деле может дать много преимуществ. как насчет возможности свободно отправлять деньги в любую точку мира без каких-либо разрешений или третьих лиц, таких как банк? или владеть активом, который не может быть захвачен? люди в сша и других развитых странах могут считать это само собой разумеющимся, но люди в таких государствах, как зимбабве и венесуэла, хватаются за биткоин как за спасительную соломинку, которая может дать им надежду на выживание. поэтому, возможно, все эти затраты на сложные вычислительные процессы не расточительны: может быть, майнеры превращают энергию в нечто более ценное.источник: bitcoin, биткоин, криптовалюта :( leave a comment ) archive apr2018 smtwtfs 1234567 891011121314 15161718192021 22232425262728 2930 tags виэ, сша, украина, экология, альтернативная энергетика, альтернативная энергия, блокчейн, вебинар, велосипед, вода, вторая жизнь вещей, деревья, дети, дом, дом из соломы, еда, загрязнение окружающей среды, защита окружающей среды, здоровье, изменение климата, мировая экология, мусор, общество потребления, органические продукты, органическое земледелие, осознанное воспитание, осознанное потребление, переработанные материалы, переработка мусора, пластик, потребление, природа, советы, сознательное потребление, солнечная батарея, солнечная панель, солнечная энергетика, солнечная энергия, солнечные батареи, солнечные панели, технологии, устойчивое развитие, фермерские продукты, цитаты, экодом, экологичный образ жизни, экология, экопоселение, экостроительство, электромобили, … powered by livejournal.com ?

__label__low pilotepro.fr - aventure d'un pilote français au québec bonjour à tous(tes). vous pouvez lire sur ce blog mon histoire racontée jours après jours durant ma vie au québec, ainsi que des photos et vidéos de mes vols durant ma formation de pilote. ceci me permet de vous présenter pas à pas mon évolution, et de vous faire partager mon métier et ma passion: l'aviation transport canada and faa cpl/me/ir/fi atpl jaa réussi 1200h total, 1050h pic, 700h fi home ajouter à mes favoris. me contacter niagara falls tour 2 sept-îles spotting 1er solo test en vol cpl test en vol ifr québec 10 médévac ma région la gaspésie samedi 14 novembre 2009 un vol particulier... il y a quelques semaines une famille appelle ma compagnie pour faire un "vol coqueluche". mais qu'est-ce donc ?la coqueluche est une maladie très contagieuse due à une bactérie du nom de bordetella pertussis (incroyable les recherches que l'on peut faire sur le net !). elle se caractérise par de violentes quintes de toux suivies d’une respiration difficile appelée « chant du coq ».le « vol de coqueluche » ou « méthode strasbourgeoise » a été inventé dans la première moitié du xxe siècle par le docteur matter pour soigner la coqueluche.son principe est le suivant : monter le plus rapidement possible entre 9500 pieds et 11 500 pieds d'altitude dans un avion non pressurisé, y rester une cinquantaine de minutes, redescendre aussi rapidement que possible, en respectant un palier à 5000 pieds.pourquoi, en avion non pressurisé, les malades retrouvaient-ils leur vitalité ?qui dit « brutale ascension » dit « raréfaction de l’oxygène », ce qui entraîne un changement de pression au niveau du sang. les molécules d’oxyhémoglobine (qui ça ?), transporteuses de l’oxygène dans le sang, relâchent cet élément en plus grande quantité qu’à l’ordinaire. cette libération accrue d’oxygène a des conséquences très positives sur la vitalité.ce procédé permet, non pas d’avoir plus d’oxygène, ce qui serait dangereux, mais d’utiliser au mieux l’oxygène de l’air naturellement disponible, sans danger et sans effets secondaires.cette technique optimise l’action des médicaments et lutte contre leur possible effets secondaires.j'ai donc fait ce vol pour le moins étrange à première vu, mais qui finalement a peut-être guéri cette mère et ces 3 enfants âgés d'environ 4 ans. (n'ayant pas eut de retour je suppose qu'ils vont mieux :))on se serait cru dans un épisode de dr. house, mes passagers et moi-mêmes ayant des masques médicaux stériles, légèrement effrayant pour les enfants, en pleur durant la totalité du vol !le vol a été plutôt plaisant pour moi, en c-182rg turbo, la montée à 11 500 pieds s'est faite en 10 minutes environ, une altitude où je n'ai pas le droit d'y rester plus de 30min sans apport d'oxygène supplémentaire. j'ai du redescendre quelques instants à 9 500' avant d'y remonter pour une vingtaine de minutes encore.quant à la descente qui doit être rapide... elle l'a été !environ 4000' / minutes, au grand "non-bonheur" des oreilles de mes passagers malades, pour qui j'ai du ralentir cette descente !en tout cas, cette journée là restera une expérience parmi les autres, et à 11 500' l'air est pur, et tout parait petit, surtout les hommes... publié par juju à 23:47 3 commentaires articles plus récents articles plus anciens accueil inscription à : articles (atom) qui suis-je ? julien, né à nice, pilote professionnel, instructeur de vol tcca et faacpl/ir/fi/me/atpl ambiance... mon logbook au 17/03/2010 mes récits ... ► 2011 (1) ► août (1) ► 2010 (3) ► octobre (1) ► mars (1) ► février (1) ▼ 2009 (15) ▼ novembre (1) un vol particulier... ► septembre (2) ► juillet (2) ► juin (2) ► mai (2) ► avril (3) ► mars (2) ► février (1) ► 2008 (53) ► décembre (4) ► novembre (5) ► octobre (5) ► septembre (4) ► août (5) ► juillet (5) ► juin (5) ► mai (5) ► avril (5) ► mars (4) ► février (5) ► janvier (1) ► 2007 (36) ► décembre (2) ► novembre (5) ► octobre (7) ► septembre (1) ► août (3) ► juillet (2) ► mai (3) ► avril (1) ► mars (4) ► février (4) ► janvier (4) photo du jour mes liens favoris rollinks transfers au pays de l'azur... blog de steve danny's news... le blog de fabien le blog de jj le blog de mon ami tributaire :-) le meilleur de l'aviation suivre par email :-) visiteurs ... compteur

what they are doing is illegal on many highways, as there is usually a minimum speed of 45mph required on such highways. driving too slowly poses a hazard not only to you, but also to everyone else using that highway. plus, it's annoying to everyone, and you could be ticketed for it. on the other hand, the speed limit on most highways is 70mph during the day, and 65mph during the night. once again, the speed limit varies from highway to highway, as there are some that don't get very much traffic at all, and therefore the limit is slightly increased for these places. 2. stay in the right lane keep a close eye on any signs that may read "left lane for passing only", as these are especially common in states such as texas. contrary to popular belief, not all highways dedicate the left lane as the "fast" lane, as there are some highways that dedicate these left lanes strictly as passing lanes. it is acceptable to use these left lanes for passing, but not to use them continuously for cruising. move off to a lane on the right immediately after you are finished passing a car. such passing lanes are also more common on larger, multi-lane highways. failure to abide by this rule can result in a fine as high as $200 in the state of texas. 3. stay alert for trucks on the highway trucks can sometimes weigh up to 40 tons, and require up to 100 yards to come to a complete stop. one good piece of advice is to keep a safe distance behind trucks by watching when the truck in front of you passes a fixed object, then, seeing if it takes you at least two seconds to pass that same object. if it takes less than two seconds for you to pass that same object, you are driving too closely to that truck. also, don't try to nudge your way between a truck and the curb, as it is a horrendously bad idea. trucks make wide right turns, having several blind spots up to 200 feet behind their trailer, or up to 20 feet in front of the tractor. in other words, they may not see you. a good rule of thumb is that if you can't see the driver's windows or the actual truck driver, then they cannot see you. lastly, never pass a truck from behind when it is in reverse. 4. moving over for emergency vehicles many people naturally move an extra lane away from a stopped emergency vehicle that has bright red flashing lights. this is a correct maneuver, as the law requires you to do this. however, did you know that it is usually also required that you go 20mph below the posted speed limit as you do so? in states such as texas, you could receive a fine of $200 for not following these two rules. tips for road trips and longer drives 5. taking a break being drowsy can be downright deadly when driving on a highway, or anywhere for that matter. driver fatigue is an obvious indication that you are not alert enough to drive safely. if you suddenly find yourself yawning incessantly, drifting unintentionally from lane to lane, or find your eyelids closing intermittently due to tiredness, then pull over to a safe place, and stretch your legs. rest for 15-20 minutes, and repeat this every two hours or so, or better yet, just take a short nap in a safe place, if possible. the best way to combat driver fatigue is to simply prevent it beforehand by preparing yourself. get plenty of rest before a long drive, and avoid any drinking from midnight to 6 o'clock. even tiny amounts of alcohol are enough to influence your reaction time when driving. 6. rest areas are your friend large rest areas are places where you can park your car in a safe environment, and they almost always have law enforcement present. use these places to your advantage as a place of rest, using the bathroom, checking out road conditions, or learning about local points of interest. driving tips highway driving new drivers teen drivers more to explore motorcycle lane spliting on the highway teen driving privileges top riding tips for first-time motorcycle owners teen drinking and driving comments view the discussion thread. save money on car insurance now! enter zip code ads by google recommended for you commercial insurance motorcycle insurance online drivers education state motor vehicle search top insurance providers in your area: privacy policy at what time are you allowed to pass a school bus?

__label__low cgc events recipes photos cornell gourmet club welcome to the blog of the cornell gourmet club january 13, 2011 digging the pig posted by elliesbelly under main courses leave a comment nine- hour roasted pork shoulder, from the new york times there is something truly magical about pork. whether it’s in heavenly bacon form or shredded on a sandwich with barbecue sauce, i really dig the pig. and for a chilly place like ithaca, comforting and meltingly tender pork shoulder is just the ticket. it’s a relatively inexpensive, tough, and somewhat gnarly-looking piece of meat from the shoulder of a pig, and can come with a fat cap on top that is best left on to baste the meat as it cooks. i first tried making pork shoulder, or boston butt as some say, one summer when i had little else to do. my goal was to tackle pulled pork over our little kettle grill but ended up getting impatient with the ten pounds of meat and took it off the heat much too early. my parents smiled politely but i knew it didn’t taste right. i looked up more recipes and found that secret to that beautiful meat you can cut with a spoon is a low temperature and a lot of time. i set to work and found new ways to prepare the cut – it’s adaptable to all kinds of cuisines, and can add a porky punch to soups and stews where it is not necessarily the main attraction. here are a few of my favorites: – swap one inch cubes of pork shoulder for beef in a chili recipe, simmering for 2-2 1/2 hours until tender (yields easily to a fork) – cook the same one inch cubes catalan-style with smoked paprika, green olives, onions and tomatoes until tender for a satisfying winter stew (thanks food and wine mag!) – braise cubes in a thai-style broth with coconut milk, chicken stock, lemongrass, thai curry paste, and lime until tender; serve over rice – pat a 5 to 6 pound cut with barbecue spice rub and cook low and slow in a 225 degree oven for 6 to 7 hours, shredding and serving with barbecue sauce and buns for a crowd – for the nyt roasted pork shoulder in the image above, turn the oven down to 200 and rub a 7 to 8 pound pork shoulder with olive oil, salt, and pepper. roast for 9 to 10 hours until pork can be shredded easily with a fork. serve with salsa verde, recipe at or with a homemade specialty of your own. the above roasted shoulder recipe came from a group dinner held by a cooking school in los angeles, called the “pork dinner.” that’s something i could make the trip for! hopefully, on a cold ithaca weekend a real live pig dinner will be coming to an apartment near you. advertisements share this:emailfacebookprintlike this:like loading... related leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here... fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: email (required) (address never made public) name (required) website you are commenting using your wordpress.com account.
